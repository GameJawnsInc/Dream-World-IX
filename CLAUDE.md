## 1. What this project is now

It began as "add one playable custom room to FF9 (Steam, Memoria engine)." **That is
long done** — multiple fully-playable minted fields exist, verified in real gameplay.

It is now **`ff9mapkit`**: a Python toolkit + Blender add-on that compiles a declarative
**`field.toml`** into a complete drop-in Memoria mod — a brand-new FF9 field with camera,
walkmesh, painted art, NPCs, dialogue, gateways, encounters, events, story branching,
cutscenes, and ladders — and can **import/fork any of FF9's ~674 real fields**. It runs on
**stock Memoria** (the shipped mod is engine-independent; a local *dev* engine adds only an
F6 debug menu). Likely the first practical reference for FF9 custom-field authoring.

Current work is **feature expansion / research / polish + release prep**, not "ship a room."
The toolkit lives at `ff9mapkit/` (package `ff9mapkit/ff9mapkit/`, Blender add-on
`ff9mapkit/blender/`). The dev-loop tools live at repo-root `tools/`.

## 2. Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

- **I cannot see the running game.** After any change that should be visible in-game,
  STOP and ask the human to playtest and report. Never assume it worked because it built.
- **I cannot paint background art.** Pre-rendered backgrounds + their depth layers are a
  human/art task. (I *do* tell the human exactly where to paint via the projection math.)
- **The human owns final in-game alignment judgment.** I author the camera + walkmesh from
  math (this is solved — §7), but the human confirms it lands on the art in real gameplay.
- **Back up before editing any game/engine file** → `backups/<file>.<timestamp>`. The base
  game + the user's install are the only source of truth if we corrupt something.
- **One change per in-game test.** When a build breaks, we need to know which edit did it.
- **Commit only when the user asks. NOTHING PUBLIC** — no `git push`/remote, no PRs, no PyPI,
  no forum/Discord posts. Local commits only. (Standing instruction, repeated across sessions.)

**I CAN own, end to end:** the field event script (`.eb` bytecode, authored in Python — no
Hades Workshop), camera + walkmesh math, exits/gateways, triggers, flags, dialogue/text,
encounters + BGM + battle-bg metadata, the whole `ff9mapkit` codebase, the local Memoria
engine build, the build/deploy loop, version control, and all docs/notes.

## 3. Environment & key paths

| Thing | Path |
|---|---|
| Game install | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY IX\` |
| Live mod folder | `<game>\FF9CustomMap\` (StreamingAssets + DictionaryPatch.txt + BattlePatch.txt) |
| Memoria source clone | `C:\gd\FFIX\Memoria\` (gitignored; the engine build tree — shared, not per-worktree) |
| Memoria.ini | `<game>\Memoria.ini` (engine toggles; dev build has boosters/ini cheats) |
| Toolkit | `ff9mapkit/` — CLI `py -m ff9mapkit <cmd>` (run from the kit root so the local pkg shadows any editable install) |
| Deploy tool | `tools/deploy_field.py <field.toml> [--id N]` (default test slot = field 4003) |
| GUI apps | in **`apps/`**: `ff9_studio.pyw` = the **launcher** (front door to all GUIs) · `ff9_build_gui.pyw` (build+deploy — auto-detects **field / campaign / battle map**) · `ff9_editor.pyw` (logic editor) · `ff9_infohub.pyw` (Info Hub viewer) |
| Reference field scripts | `reference/test2/` (gitignored, 817 HW field-script exports) + `reference/field-manifest.tsv` (HW-index→field-id→name; index ≠ field id) |
| FF9 field assets | `<game>\StreamingAssets\p0data*.bin` (UnityRaw 5.2.3 bundles; UnityPy reads them — `py -m pip install UnityPy`) |

> **Git layout:** worktrees share one install but each deploys into its OWN Memoria mod folder, so
> they never share a `DictionaryPatch.txt` and can't clobber each other. (The old single-`FF9CustomMap`
> + `--id` scheme broke: `deploy_field.py`'s revert/revert-prior does a WHOLESALE DictionaryPatch
> restore from a pre-deploy snapshot, so a deploy on one worktree silently wiped a sibling's
> `FieldScene` line → black-screen warp to an unregistered id.) Each worktree pins its target in a
> gitignored **`.ff9deploy.toml`** (`mod_folder` + `id`; override via `--mod-folder`/`$FF9_MOD_FOLDER`);
> `Memoria.ini [Mod] FolderNames` stacks the folders and each folder's own DictionaryPatch/BattlePatch
> is read at launch (`DataPatchers.Initialize`). Per-worktree slots live in the scratch band: `C:\gd\FFIX`
> master → `FF9CustomMap`/**30000** · `C:\gd\FFIX-battle-backgrounds` → `FF9CustomMap-bb`/**30001** ·
> `C:\gd\FFIX-infohub-catalog` → `FF9CustomMap-ih`/**30002** (existing worktrees migrate by editing their
> gitignored `.ff9deploy.toml` id + relaunching once to register it). **Distinct ids still required**
> (EventDB/SceneData are GLOBAL, merged from every folder at launch → same id across folders collides).
> New worktree: drop a `.ff9deploy.toml` (id 30000-32767), add its folder to `Memoria.ini FolderNames`,
> relaunch. Reach any slot via F6 → Warp.
> **Field-id bands** (`pack.py`; engine cap: the live `FF9StateSystem.Common.FF9.fldMapNo` is **Int16 → max
> 32767**, so a higher DictionaryPatch id *registers* but is unreachable): **10-3100** real fields (locked) ·
> **4000-9899** shipped custom content in 100-id blocks (`pack.suggest_base`) · **30000-32767** ephemeral
> dev/test scratch slots (the per-worktree deploy targets). Wiring `suggest_base` into `ff9mapkit new` /
> the Campaign Editor is a future task.
> **Merge discipline (keeps CLAUDE.md current, cheaply):** do all CLAUDE.md edits on the *feature*
> branch and let `master` only ever **fast-forward** — it stays a clean receiver, so the FF is
> conflict-free and master's CLAUDE.md never goes stale. FF from this worktree without checking out
> master: `git -C C:\gd\FFIX merge --ff-only infohub-catalog` (keep the master worktree clean first —
> an uncommitted file there blocks the FF; stash it, FF, pop).
> **Two branches feeding master concurrently:** the FF-only model assumes ONE feeder at a time. If the
> *other* branch FFs master while you have un-merged commits, your branch diverges and a plain FF becomes
> impossible — that's expected, NOT an emergency (diverged branches sit fine until the next FF). Fix:
> `git rebase master` (replays your commits onto it; resolve same-file doc conflicts **keep-both**), then
> the `--ff-only` merge above. Deterministic — whoever merges **second** rebases; only files BOTH branches
> edited (e.g. CLAUDE.md §10) conflict, so it's usually one paragraph + a clean replay.

## 4. The dev loop (no relaunch needed)

The proven fast loop — **edit → deploy → F6**:

1. Author/edit a `field.toml` (by hand, the form editor, or a Blender export).
2. `py tools/deploy_field.py <field.toml> [--id N]` — builds + deploys reversibly into the
   custom-field test slot (default 4003 = `TESTROOM`). It sandboxes ANY field.toml into that
   id+name, reverts the slot's prior deploy, and writes a per-id `revert_deploy_<id>.py`.
3. In-game press **F6 → Reload field** (re-reads the current field's mod files from disk:
   `.eb`/`.mes`/scene/walkmesh/art) **or → Warp to field → <id>**.
4. Ask the human to verify. Each change = one commit + one in-game check.

**Relaunch is only needed for:** the FIRST deploy of a *new* id (to register its
DictionaryPatch line), a BattlePatch change, or an engine-DLL rebuild. Reverting a deploy:
`py tools/scroll_out/revert_deploy.py` (latest) or `revert_deploy_<id>.py`.

**Engine builds** (changing `Assembly-CSharp.dll`): MSBuild VS18 BuildTools, build the csproj
with **`/p:SolutionDir=C:\gd\FFIX\Memoria\`** (trailing `\` required, else mscorlib conflict).
⚠ The build **AUTO-DEPLOYS** to the game (x64+x86 Managed) with **no backup** — back up the
DLL first. Version-match: stay near the installed compile-date's `main` commit (`6b8bb2d5`).
New `.cs` files must be added to the csproj `<Compile Include>`. See memory `project-ff9-memoria-build`.

---

## 5. Current state (keep this updated)

- **Dev engine** = stock Memoria `6b8bb2d5` + the **F6 debug menu only** (`UIKeyTrigger.cs` +
  `Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs`; patch `memoria-patches/s22-debug-menu-f6.patch`). Boosters are manual
  (ini cheats + F1–F4). The *shipped* mod needs none of this — it's engine-independent.
  Revert engine → no-edits rebuild: `tools/restore_memoria_dll.py baseline`; true stock = re-run the patcher.
- **F6 debug menu** (dev build, in **FIELD and BATTLE** — in-game proven 2026-06-09): a draggable tabbed
  IMGUI popup —
  **Warp** (reload field · warp to any registered custom id ≥4000) ·
  **Move** (teleport to x,z · right-click the field to copy the floor (x,z) under the cursor) ·
  **Cheats** (booster toggles · full-heal · give item/gil) ·
  **Flags** (get/set/clear a `gEventGlobal` story flag · snapshot/restore · reset-all) ·
  **Time** (0.25–4× time-scale). The menu is a `DontDestroyOnLoad` MonoBehaviour so its OnGUI already
  draws in battle; the F6 toggle gate (`UIKeyTrigger.Update`) was widened from `FieldHUD` to
  `FieldHUD || BattleHUD`. In battle the field-only **Warp/Move** tabs show a "field only" note and
  no-op; **Cheats/Flags/Time** operate on the shared party/flag/time state (handy for testing battle
  maps). Battle is NOT auto-paused while open (so Time-tab slow-mo persists on close) and NGUI input
  under the popup isn't blocked — keep the window top-left, off the battle command UI. **This SUPERSEDES
  the old single-key F6-reload / F10-reset hotkeys — do not refer to those as current.**
- **Canonical demo content:** two painted "Vivi" hut rooms — **4000** exterior + **4002**
  interior — door round-trip, a talking Vivi NPC, and an encounter. The clean packaged copy lives in
  **`release/FF9CustomMap/`** (the known-good source), now **100% kit-authored** — the SE-derived
  Alexandria field-100 door `.eb` was removed in the provenance cleanup (the field-100 path already
  crashed / was off the New-Game route), so the demo is the two painted hut rooms.
- **The live dev `FF9CustomMap` is a churned scratchpad** — test deploys overwrite/remove scene
  folders, so the hut's `FBG_N11_HUT_*` scenes are frequently absent (they are right now;
  FieldMaps holds only the test-slot scenes). **To actually play the hut, redeploy it from
  `release/`.** Registered fields: 4000 HUT_EXT, 4002 HUT_INT, **4003 = the shared test slot**
  (`deploy_field.py`, currently a CPMP ladder fork).
- **Debug New-Game warp** jumps straight to **field 4003** (entrance 11) — NOT through
  Alexandria (the route-through-100 hop was abandoned because field 100 crashes). Field **100
  (Alexandria)** holds the door wiring + known debug-hack breakage (dead `Field(4004)` + a
  spawn inside a gateway zone) — off the New-Game path now; a real story entrance would rebuild it.
- **Versions:** kit `0.9.9`, Blender add-on `0.9.7`. **Provenance gate is CLEARED** — the
  repo ships ZERO Square-Enix bytes; base templates are regenerated from the user's own
  install via `ff9mapkit extract-templates` (patches + SHA-256 manifest). `*.eb.bytes` /
  `*.bgx` / `*.bgi.bytes` are gitignored (except our own hut quad).
- **Open public item (do NOT act):** Memoria PR #1433 (FieldCreatorScene PNG-path fix) — left
  as-is, irrelevant to the toolkit. Nothing else pending; standing constraint = nothing public.

---

## 6. The toolkit at a glance (capabilities — all in-game proven)

`ff9mapkit` compiles `field.toml` → mod. The full content/scripting stack, each verified in
real gameplay and reproducible in Python (zero Hades Workshop):

- **Field & scene:** mint a custom field id (≥4000); single / **scrolling** / **multi-camera**
  cameras; human-painted art layers with depth-based occlusion; walkmesh authored from math OR
  imported/reshaped from a real field.
- **Content:** NPCs (any model + animations, by name) · dialogue (speaker tag, auto-wrap) ·
  gateways (round-trip doors) · encounters (+ field/battle BGM, after-battle fix) · **events**
  (chests / gil / story flags / triggers) · **story branching** (flag-gated NPCs / doors /
  events) · **dialogue choices** (NPC + zone, default/cancel rows, static + flag-gated hide) ·
  **cutscenes** (narration v1 + actor walk/path/turn/animation/teleport v2) · **ladders**
  (navigable, vertical/slant/bent shapes, floor/gateway/worldmap tops, re-entry) · **props**
  (static set-dressing — chests/tents/save-points/barrels/ladders/signs — via the real FF9 recipe:
  `SetModel` + a static pose + `EnableHeadFocus(0)`; `[[prop]] prop = "chest"` or `model` + `pose`).
- **Import/fork:** `ff9mapkit import <field>` (BG-borrow or `--editable` custom-scene) +
  `list-fields` — fork any of **674** real fields (camera + walkmesh + gateways/BGM/encounters
  extracted offline from p0data). Blender "Import FF9 Field" gives a visual fork→author loop.
- **Authoring surfaces:** declarative `field.toml`; the **scene.toml (Blender, spatial) /
  field.toml (logic)** split; the **form editor** `ff9mapkit edit`; the **Blender add-on**
  (camera/walkmesh/layers + NPC/gateway/event/spawn/waypoint/cam-zone markers).
- **Info Hub catalogs:** `ff9mapkit models | animations | scenes | items | catalog` — browse
  GEO models, anims, battle scenes, items, fields by name (baked from Memoria source,
  provenance-clean); the model→animation join is engine-sound.
- **Build-time validation** (offline, since I can't see the game): content off the walkmesh /
  within the collision radius of a wall, stranded floors, broken seams, zero-area triangles,
  layer aspect mismatch, camera pitch range, dead story flags, unknown model/item names.
  `ff9mapkit lint <toml>` / `ff9mapkit walkmesh verify <path>`.

Always **fork/learn from a real field's bytes** before authoring a new mechanic — every
mechanic above was grounded byte-for-byte against shipping FF9 data, not invented.

## 7. Hard-won facts & gotchas (load-bearing — deep recipes in §9 memory)

**Custom fields / BG**
- Mint via DictionaryPatch `FieldScene <id> <area> <MAPID> <NAME> <textid>`; custom ids ≥ 4000.
- **BG-borrow**: point `<area>`+`<MAPID>` at a real field's art. **`<area>` MUST be ≥ 10** —
  the loader builds `"FBG_N"+area` with no zero-padding and reads exactly 2 chars, so
  single-digit areas (0–9) black-screen. (`--editable` forks remap a low area to ≥10.) → `project-ff9-bg-borrow-solution`.
- Runtime always loads the compiled `.eb` (no text→.eb path). Per-language `.eb` differ ONLY
  in the 84-byte name field; **bytecode is language-identical** → byte-patch the code region at
  the same offset in all 7 langs. → `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling`.

**Camera / projection / canvas** (`project-ff9-camera-math`)
- Invariant: `R_ff9 = diag(1, 14/15, 1)·R_ortho` (vertical-focal aspect; **k = 14/15** is a
  global constant baked into orientation row 1). Author any camera from math (`cam.synth_r_t`).
- **Canvas map is EXACT scale-1**: `canvasX = rawProj.x + w/2`, `canvasY = h/2 − rawProj.y`
  (proven to 0.0005 px vs an in-engine probe). The old per-pitch `sx/sy` (0.926/0.889) were an
  eyeball fit silently absorbing constants — **dead**.
- **Character ground offset = 0** (engine-measured). The legacy `org=(0,0,300)` +
  `CHARACTER_GROUND_OFFSET_Z=298` were a near-cancelling double-count — **ripped**; new
  walkmeshes use `frame="world"` (org=0, no offset).
- `COLLISION_RADIUS_W ≈ 48` (= `bgiRad*4`): the player CENTRE can't reach a walkmesh edge —
  extend the walkmesh ~48u past the painted floor if the player should reach the visual edge.
- **Art / canvas wiring:** logical canvas **384×448**; painted PNGs are **4× upscaled** (a full
  layer = 1536×1792). An overlay's `Position` = top-left logical px (Y-down), `Size` = px/4,
  `Z` = depth (**smaller Z = in front of the character** → occlusion); overlay world placement is
  the scale-1 inverse of `to_canvas`.
- **Scrolling:** build `proj` from the visible **window width (384)** and only widen `Range` for
  a wider painting — naively widening `proj` DOUBLES the FOV (the kit's `[camera] window_width`).
- Yaw: `R = rot_x(pitch)·rot_y(−yaw)` (post-multiply keeps the origin centred). Control
  direction is auto-derived from yaw: `value = round(yaw/360·256) − 1` (front-facing = −1).
- The editor's **5-point anchor solver is degenerate for flat floors** (rank-deficient) — DEAD
  END; use the math, not the editor, for cameras.

**Walkmesh / import** (`project-ff9-import-frame`)
- A real field's walkmesh world position = **`vert + orgPos + floor.org`** (universal; multi-
  floor tiles via per-floor `floor.org`; single-floor `floor.org=0`). This is THE frame rule.
- Real `.bgi` floors are **disjoint vertex sets, corner-origin per floor.** Rebuilding neighbor
  links by shared vertex INDEX loses cross-floor seams → **ship the real `.bgi` verbatim**, or
  reshape via `obj + links` (a position-keyed seam sidecar). The `.bgi` codec is lossless; only
  the `.obj` intermediate drops adjacency.
- **`IsInQuad`/`TreadQuad` test a FAN of consecutive vertex-triplets, not the real polygon** —
  3 collinear points = a zero-area triangle = a DEAD ZONE. Use a convex quad with the last
  vertex DOUBLED. → `project-ff9-gateway-regions`.

**Regions / gateways** (`project-ff9-gateway-regions`)
- Region triggers only fire when `usercontrol == 1`. **Region tag 2 = tread** (every frame in
  the quad), **tag 3 = press-to-interact** (action button), **tag 10 = Main_Reinit** (runs after
  battle). The player must actually REACH the zone (place it where he demonstrably stands).
- Exit walk-out direction is set by the polygon's **point ORDER** (q[0]→q[1] edge first = walk
  forward, no "circle").

**Encounters / battle** (`project-ff9-encounters`)
- A field cloned from a cutscene field lacks an entry-0 **tag-10 Main_Reinit** → after-battle
  **softlock** (`EnterBattleEnd` suspends objects; nothing resumes them). Fix: add a tag-10 that
  `FadeFilter(2,16,…)` (overrides BattleResultUI's 256-frame timed fade) + re-enables move.
- BattlePatch `Music:` = the akao **song-play id** (0 = Battle Theme), NOT a file number. Field
  BGM = `RunSoundCode(0, <song id>)` (song id, not file number; Vivi's Theme = 9).

**`.eb` scripting** (`project-ff9-eb-script-tooling` — full opcode table; kit `eb/_optables.py` is authoritative)
- Format: 44B header + 84B PSX name → entry table at offset **128** (10 slots × 8B); a
  function's `fpos` is measured from `entryStart+2`; 2-byte opcodes are prefixed `0xFF`.
- Opcode traps worth memorizing: **`Battle = 0x2A`** (NOT PreloadField — encoding a warp as
  0x2A starts a battle on a bad scene id → crash/black); real `PreloadField = 0xFD` is a no-op
  HINT on Steam; `Field = 0x2B` is the real warp; **`0x01` is an undocumented unconditional
  JMP** (don't overwrite a Wait that sits right after it — the activation is skipped). Camera/
  scroll mechanics: **`SETCAM = 0x7E`** (switch active camera), **`BGCACTIVE = 0x71`** (enable
  scroll / camera-services).
- **Expression sub-language**: opcode `0x05` + a `0x7F`-terminated RPN stack; var token byte =
  `0xC0 | (type<<2) | source`. `B_SYSVAR=0x7A` (code 9 = `GetChoose`, reads the picked choice
  row); `GetItemCount` = expr fn `0x64`. Reusable for chests/levers/choices.
- **Actor cutscene choreography MUST run in the NPC's LOOP (tag 1), not its Init (tag 0).**
  `ProcessAnime` advances `animFrame` only when `obj.state == 1`; Init runs at `state == 2`, so
  Init-spliced movement updates the transform but FREEZES the skeleton (glide, no emote). Also:
  a **warm-up `Wait(~30)`** before the first actor command (entry-transition settle, else the
  walk circles + the synchronous walk hangs); `SetWalkTurnSpeed(255)` to avoid the
  walk-to-a-point-behind orbit/softlock; **never `WaitTurn`/`WaitAnimation` on a player-cloned
  NPC** (its clips don't complete those → softlock — use instant turns + a fixed `Wait(40)`);
  `MoveInstantXZY` args are `(worldX, −worldY, worldZ)` + `SetPathing(1)` after (it disables
  walkmesh collision).

**Story flags — persistence** (the bug that bit every once-gated thing)
- A var's **source** decides persistence: **GLOB (src 0) = save-backed `gEventGlobal`** (2048
  bytes, persists across field reloads + saves) vs **MAP (src 1) = per-field, WIPED on every
  field load.** HW naming is INVERTED (HW "GlobBool" = engine **Map** = transient).
- `EventContext.mapvar` is **only 80 bytes** → a high flag index in MAP space is out-of-bounds
  = hard crash. **Use GLOB for chests / story flags / cutscene-once.** The kit uses `GLOB_BOOL
  = 0xC4` (transient dev twin = `MAP_BOOL = 0xC5`) with flag bases in the **8000+** band (clear
  of base-game flags); indices > 0xFF need the long-index token encoding (`class|0x20` + 2-byte
  LE) — which is why the 8000 band works. `gEventGlobal` index N → byte `N>>3`, bit `N&7`.
- A `once=true` event/cutscene won't replay for *testing* once its persistent flag is set —
  use `once=false`, a fresh New Game, a distinct flag index, or F6 → Flags → reset.

**Dev engine** (`project-ff9-memoria-build`)
- Read dev hotkeys in a real MonoBehaviour `Update()` (e.g. `UIKeyTrigger`) via
  `UnityXInput.Input` — **NOT** `HonoLateUpdate` (the ~30 fps logical tick misses `GetKeyDown`).

**Process**
- **Hades Workshop is fully out of the loop** — its custom-field atlas clone has a systemic UV
  bug, and its export CORRUPTS entry-adds. Author `.eb` in Python (verify with `eb_disasm` /
  the kit before deploy). → `project-ff9-mint-gotchas`, `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling`.
- **Never edit a bundled example in place** — the form editor's Save will rewrite the
  byte-exact golden oracle. Author on a copy / `ff9mapkit new` / a Blender export.
- Grep alone can't prove a field is unused — FF9 cutscenes fire from C# tables
  (`NarrowMapList.cs`), not just field scripts. Trust the user's game knowledge over grep.
  → `feedback_trust_user_game_knowledge`, `project_ff9_has_no_unused_fields`.

---

## 8. Dead ends (proven — don't re-explore)

- **HW "Export as Custom Field" atlas clone** — systemic UV bug (A/B tested on two bases). Use
  BG-borrow or `--editable` custom scenes instead.
- **HW adding a new `.eb` entry** — corrupts the file (overwrites the player object). Python only.
- **The FieldCreator editor's 5-point camera anchor on a flat floor** — mathematically degenerate.
- **Encoding a field warp as opcode `0x2A`** — that's `Battle`, not PreloadField → crash/black.
- **A uniform `orgPos/2` walkmesh slide / an `f0`-vs-`+org` frame auto-detector** — the import
  frame is always `vert + orgPos + floor.org`; no heuristic.
- **Per-pitch `sx/sy` canvas scale** — the map is exact scale-1; the "back-edge drift" was the
  character collision radius, not a map error.

---

## 9. Project memory (the deep recipes)

Read these on demand — they hold the full technical detail this file only summarizes
(`~/.claude/projects/C--gd-FFIX/memory/`, indexed by `MEMORY.md`):

- `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling` — `.eb` format + opcode tables, Python injection, custom
  text/MES, the F6 debug menu, the cutscene-in-LOOP rule, flag persistence.
- `project-ff9-camera-math` — the projection invariant, decompose/synthesize, scale-1 canvas
  map, character offset, yaw, multi-camera convention.
- `project-ff9-import-frame` — the `vert + orgPos + floor.org` walkmesh frame; simple vs multi-floor forks.
- `project-ff9-novel-bg-pipeline` — painted-BG / overlay-depth / occlusion pipeline.
- `project-ff9-gateway-regions` — region trigger mechanics + IsInQuad dead zones.
- `project-ff9-encounters` — random battles + the after-battle Main_Reinit fix.
- `project-ff9-memoria-build` — local engine build toolchain + auto-deploy + version-match.
- `project-ff9-bg-borrow-solution`, `project-ff9-mint-proven`, `project-ff9-mint-gotchas` — minting + BG-borrow + HW dead-ends.
- `feedback_trust_user_game_knowledge`, `project_ff9_has_no_unused_fields`,
  `project_ff9_field_warp_pattern`, `reference_ff9_modding_community` — process + community.

## 10. Milestone timeline (the trail, compressed — full story in git)

- **S0–1** — Recon; build/test loop proven; field 1357 (Hangar) is a complete playable map.
- **S2–4** — MINT proven (custom field ids work); HW atlas clone is broken → **BG-borrow** the
  solution (real art via DictionaryPatch, area ≥10).
- **S5–8** — Novel painted BGs: borrowed-camera walkmesh, human-painted art, walkmesh↔floor
  alignment + foreground occlusion all working in-game.
- **S9** — `.eb` content authored directly in **Python** (HW dropped): NPCs, talk triggers,
  custom dialogue text (mod `.mes` at a high TXID).
- **S10** — **Camera math cracked**: author/decompose/synthesize ANY angle; exact scale-1
  canvas map; novel-angle room calibrated + walkable.
- **S11** — Two connected painted rooms (gateways) + first encounter with the after-battle fix.
- **S12** — Local Memoria engine build; fade/BGM/encounter/cold-start fixes; custom room wired
  into **Alexandria** (real-world round trip).
- **S13** — **`ff9mapkit` built** (field.toml → mod) + the **Blender add-on**; the back-edge
  anomaly cracked (scale-1 map + collision radius).
- **S14** — Blender visual authoring (camera/walkmesh/markers); bounds tests (concave, yaw);
  scene/field split begins.
- **S15** — **Scrolling fields** (BGCACTIVE) end-to-end + in the kit + Blender.
- **S16** — **Import any real field** from p0data (offline extraction); the universal walkmesh
  frame; simple + multi-floor forks; Blender "Import FF9 Field".
- **S17** — Faithful `.bgi` exporter; editable-art (occlusion-preserving) forks; multi-floor
  seam reconcile; the offline **build-time validation suite**.
- **S18** — Multi-camera (N cams, after-battle restore); the conditional-region primitive →
  **events / story branching / cutscenes** (narration + actor); the flag-persistence fix;
  character-offset measured 0; honest walkmesh.
- **S19** — Authorship suite: **form editor** + scene/field split + linter; **provenance gate
  cleared** (zero SE bytes); stock engine + F6; instant New-Game warp; release-prep docs.
- **S20–21** — Dialogue wrap + cutscene auto-pathing; modern editor UI; **dialogue choices**
  (default/cancel/hide, flag-gated); chest/reward conventions matched to real FF9.
- **S22** — **Ladder import** (shapes, top-actions, re-entry) + the warp-plumbing saga.
- **S23** — The **F6 debug menu** (supersedes old hotkeys); the **Info Hub catalogs**
  (models/anims/scenes/items) + `[[npc]] model` by name; ladder catalogue 100%.
- **InfoHub archetype pillar** (in-game verified) — `catalog.npc_anims`: place **any** of the 154
  field models as a working NPC by name, animations auto-resolved via the model→animation join
  (`[[npc]] model = "GEO_NPC_F0_BMG"`, no `anims` needed); `ff9mapkit models <name>` shows the
  NPC-ready slots. **Named archetypes** layer friendly one-word NPC types on top
  (`[[npc]] archetype = "garnet"` / `"black_mage"` / `"guard"` / `"innkeeper"`; `ff9mapkit archetypes`
  lists them). Builds on the read-only catalogs to make the Info Hub a real authoring pillar.
  **The archetype set is COMPLETE** (122 names / 96 models): every `GEO_NPC` field model with a full
  anim set **plus the named story cast** (`GEO_SUB` — Beatrix / Kuja / Garland / the Tantalus crew /
  the genomes / Quan / Quale / Lani / …), all identified IN-GAME via the gallery loop
  (`tools/build_archetype_gallery.py --group NPC|SUB` + `tools/model_field_usage.py`: place unknown
  models in field 4003, the human warps to each one's real fields via F6 and reports the role).
  **Animations verified in-game** via `tools/build_anim_check.py` (forces a model's idle slot to its
  walk/run clip so a whole row animates in place — walk + run clean across every rig). Full reference
  (roles, real-field locations, JP name origins): **`ff9mapkit/docs/ARCHETYPES.md`** (regenerate with
  `tools/gen_archetype_reference.py`). Guards (pytest): completeness (no unnamed `GEO_NPC`), real-idle
  (no "moonwalk"), curation (every archetype fully animated). Held out: `black_waltz_2` + Trance Kuja
  (special boss models, no standard idle/walk — place by raw model id).
- **Prop pillar** (in-game verified) — the **`[[prop]]`** section places static set-dressing (chests,
  tents, save-points, barrels, ladders, signs) by the real FF9 recipe: `SetModel` + a fixed-pose
  `SetStandAnimation` + **`EnableHeadFocus(0)`** (the engine switch that kills an NPC's turn-to-face),
  grounded byte-for-byte in shipping fields (save-moogle field 300, chest field 115), NOT emulated.
  Two engine-grounded gotchas: **`SetObjectFlags` bit 1 = "show model"** — the shipping props'
  `flags(14)` omits it → the model VANISHES, so we only disable head-focus (don't blanket-set flags);
  and a prop's true pose is a raw `SetStandAnimation` clip the model→anim name-join often lacks (the
  save book rests at 1872 = 'b'+1) → `tools/extract_prop_poses.py` harvests the canonical pose per
  model. **The GEO_ACC set-dressing catalogue is COMPLETE** — every field-placed ACC prop is a named
  archetype (**117 names / 83 models**, `prop_archetypes.py`, pose baked in), each ID'd in-game via the
  prop gallery (`tools/build_prop_gallery.py --arena`, common-first, 6/batch on the no-relaunch arena):
  basics (`chest`/`tent`/`save_book`/`ladder`/`vat`/`aircab`) plus vehicles (`gargant`/`cab_carriage`/
  `gondola`/`parade_float`/`luxury_cab`), statues + ritual (`neptune_statue`/`goddess_statue`/
  `extraction_ring`/`altar`/`wind_mirror`), machinery (`gear_wall`/`hatchery`/`weight_lift`/`pull_chain`),
  weapons (`dagger`/`spear`), and the Madain-Sari kitchen set (`fish`/`pot`/`fishing_rod`) —
  `[[prop]] prop = "chest"` or `model` + `pose`. Aliases throughout; two props (`goddess_statue` GNT,
  `collapsing_floor` KOS) have zeroed/offset origins → they render as a tiny dot alone (view them in-scene).
  Deferred (spawned task): a `[field] location_name` option to hide the borrowed-BG location-name banner.
  **Composite set pieces (in-game verified):** `[[prop]] prop = "<name>"` expands (build.py) to several parts,
  each at the prop's (x,z) plus an optional per-part `(dx,dz)` offset (`prop_archetypes.PROP_COMPOSITES`; tools:
  `find_composite_props.py` / `dump_field_objects.py`). Two ship: **`save_point`** (moogle ON book, co-located;
  the feather/letter are save-animation-only, omitted) and **`scale_set`** (the Desert Palace scale `TNB` LOADED
  — clay/stone/iron on the pans + the wood weight offset beside it). **Pose gotcha:** a set piece often needs a
  field-SPECIFIC pose, not the archetype's cross-field-canonical one — the weights canonically pose OFF-scale
  (hidden inside the body when co-located); field 2203's on-pan poses (6263/6267/6271, scale 2561) render the rack.
  **Held items (`AttachObject` 0x4C):** **`[[npc]] holds = "save_the_queen"`** puts a prop in an NPC's
  hand — attaches at the right hand-bone AND poses BOTH the prop and the holder, **auto-resolved for
  this holder's model** from a catalog of every shipping `AttachObject` (`tools/extract_attach_poses.py`
  → `_held_poses.py`: `(carrier, prop) → (bone, prop_pose, holder_pose)`). `[[prop]] attach_to = "<npc>"`
  is the manual form (uids ARE entry slots, so the kit emits the exact shipping bytes). In-game-verified
  (Beatrix + Save the Queen; a dwarf + cup). **The field-held-prop catalogue is COMPLETE** — every prop a
  character holds in a shipping field is a named archetype (sword/cup/letter/glass/ticket/hand_bell/ +
  axe/wreath/sack/log/vial/dagger_doll/brahne_doll/…), each ID'd in-game via `tools/build_held_gallery.py`
  (places each carrier holding its prop; **`--spotlight <tok>`** = one carrier slowly turning, for an
  unclear item — note: a multi-step turn cutscene only completes its FIRST turn on a player-cloned NPC).
  **GEO_WEP battle weapons do NOT apply** — they're the `B1` battle variant (no `F0`), absent from field
  scripts, so they don't render outside combat; field-held weapons are always `GEO_ACC` props.
- **Engine gotcha — `IsActuallyTalkable` reads `tag3[ip+7]`/`[ip+8]`** (the per-frame talk-icon poll), so
  an object's tag-3 (talk) func MUST be ≥ 9 bytes or it indexes past the entry buffer → an
  `IndexOutOfRangeException` every frame the player is near it. The kit's `_SpeakBTN` was 7 bytes — a
  LATENT bug on every NPC since the first one (logged, non-fatal; found by watching `Memoria.log`). Fix:
  pad short talk funcs to ≥ 9 (dead bytes after RETURN); non-interactive **props are `bare`** (Init-only,
  no tag-3 at all — matches shipping set-dressing, dodges the poll). → `content/npc.py` `bare=`/padding.
- **Battle-background pillar — feasibility + tier (a) proven** (2026-06-09) — battle maps are a SEPARATE
  pillar from fields: real textured **3D Unity meshes** (FBX, child groups `Group_0/2/4/8` = additive/
  ground/minus/sky) + a moving perspective camera computed in a closed native DLL. 177 of them
  (`BBG_B001..177`) in `p0data2.bin`. **Tier (a) — texture reskin of an existing map — is in-game proven**
  on stock Memoria (no DLL rebuild): drop PNGs named by the bundle `Texture2D.m_Name` at
  `…/StreamingAssets/Assets/Resources/BattleMap/BattleModel/battleMap_all/BBG_B###/` in a mod folder; UVs
  wrap the geometry correctly (verified with a per-texture UV checker). Scene wiring mirrors `FieldScene`
  (a `BattleScene` DictionaryPatch line). **Tier (b) — CUSTOM GEOMETRY — is also in-game proven**: Memoria
  loads a loose **FBX** from the mod folder instead of the bundle (`ModelImporter`/`FbxIO`), so a custom 3D
  battle map ships with no engine rebuild — verified with a synthetic quad AND a byte-faithful BBG_B013
  round-trip (one FBX Geometry per submesh named `Geometry::Group_N`, verts/uvs/normals verbatim, Model
  typed "Mesh", per-group PSX shader set in-FBX). **Now a first-class ff9mapkit pillar** (kit 0.9.6):
  `ff9mapkit/ff9mapkit/battle/` + CLI `battle-import`/`battle-build`/`battle-list` + `tools/deploy_battle.py`
  + a `battle.toml` (override an existing slot / `repoint_scene` / experimental `scene_id` mint). The
  earlier `tools/*bbg*` scripts were the proofs; the package supersedes them.
  **Tier (c) — NEW SCENE mint PROVEN in-game (2026-06-09):** a net-new `BattleScene <id>` (forked donor
  EF_R007 / scene 67 → id 5500 on BBG_B013 — raw16 + raw17 + eb + **mes** verbatim) loads + is fightable on
  stock Memoria (2 Goblins, correct rewards/random drops, no softlock). **The camera was NOT the blocker** —
  the donor's raw17 + 3 hardcoded static default poses (`BattleMapCameraController`, picked by the raw16
  pattern's `Camera` byte) render with zero camera authoring (the managed `SFXDataCamera` path is a TODO
  no-op). **Real gotcha: the per-lang battle `.mes` is LOAD-BEARING** — a missing `<id>.mes` → `GetBattleText`
  null → NRE in `DataPatchers.ApplyBattlePatch` → battle loads with map+camera but NO enemies/party (base
  battle text is in `x64/FF9_Data/resources.assets` as `<sceneId>.mes` TextAssets, one per lang; numeric
  `.mes` = battle, field text is named by script). Trigger = a field `SetRandomBattles(…, <id>)` encounter
  (the scene arg IS the battle id). Probe `tools/probe_tierc_scene.py` (reversible `_tierc_revert.py`).
  **C2 — WHOLLY ORIGINAL battle PROVEN in-game (2026-06-09):** a net-new `BBG_B200` (>177; our own FBX +
  blue-tinted textures + a static `INB_B200`) under minted scene 5501 — fought twice, rendered blue (= our
  files loaded, no fallback to real B013), no errors. A new bbg NUMBER is safe with a static `.inb`
  (`nf_BbgNumber` is only `== <id>` compared, never an array index; obj/uv-anim gated on `objanim>0`).
  **C4 — the full mint is WIRED INTO ff9mapkit (kit 0.9.7), in-game proven via the kit's OWN pipeline**
  (a kit-deployed `BBG_B201`/scene 5502 was fightable, survived death→menu→new-game→re-warp→win): `battle-import
  --fork-scene <DONOR> --ship-as BBG_B<N>` forks geometry + scene assets (raw16/raw17/eb/mes, gitignored
  SE-derived), `battle-build` copies them + authors a static INB + emits the `BattleScene` line,
  `deploy_battle.py --trigger-field N` installs reversibly + repoints a field encounter, `battle-list
  --scenes` lists donors. Kit-emitted raw16/raw17/eb/mes are byte-identical to the C2 probe (offline-verified);
  451 tests pass; the throwaway probes were removed (kit supersedes them). **ALL battle tiers done** (a/b/c
  + productized). **TUNE THE FIGHT (kit 0.9.8, in-game proven):** a `[scene]` section in battle.toml
  overrides a minted battle's enemy **positions** (`pos`/`y`/`rot`), **stats** (hp/mp/gil/exp/level/
  speed/strength/magic/spirit), **rewards** (`drop`/`steal`, items by name), and **camera** pose — the kit
  surgically patches the forked `raw16` (only edited bytes change) keeping enemy TYPES so raw17 stays valid
  (`battle/scene_data.py`; confirmed in-game: Goblin/Fang HP 33→1 one-shot + 9999 gil/999 exp/Phoenix Down).
  Also **spawn composition** (kit 0.9.8, in-game proven) — `monster_count` (1–4) + per-slot `type` (existing
  types only) RECOMPOSE *and GROW* the encounter. The kit writes the composition to every pattern AND
  **re-authors the battle eb's `Main_Init`** to bind one enemy-AI object per spawned slot
  (`InitObject(1+type, 0x80+slot)`, reusing the donor's per-type AI entries — entry `1+T` = type T's AI;
  `battle/event_data.py` + the new `eb/edit.replace_function_body`). This BROKE THE DONOR-COUNT LIMIT: a
  mint can now spawn more enemies than the donor natively did (1-enemy EF_R007 → four Goblins, no
  player-model twitch — every slot has a real AI object, so no death misroutes into the player via
  `EventEngine.RequestAction`). Root-caused via an ultracode workflow; the old `monster_count` cap is gone
  (errors only if a needed per-type AI entry is absent).
  **Custom CAMERA — feasibility PROVEN in-game (2026-06-09, ultracode scout + byte-edit probe):** a bespoke
  moving battle camera IS authorable by writing raw17, no DLL rebuild. The closed `FF9SpecialEffectPlugin.dll`
  is a data CONSUMER — `SFX.StartPlungeCamera` pins the raw17 and passes `(ptr,len,camOffset)` to the native
  side, which parses the camera keyframes itself; the managed `SFXDataCamera.Load/UpdateBSC` (which the kit's
  Python port mirrors) have zero call sites = pure spec. Opening shot = `cameraList[CameraNo]`, CameraNo = the
  raw16 pattern `Camera` byte (kit already writes it). Proven by rotating EF_R007's opening cam[0] 180° via an
  IN-PLACE orientation byte-edit (no offset repack) → the swoop visibly flipped. **Tier (i) SHIPPED (kit
  0.9.8, in-game confirmed):** `[scene] camera_yaw / camera_pitch / camera_zoom` offset the opening camera's
  keyframes in place (`battle/camera_data.py`); yaw + zoom predictable, **pitch finicky** (offset onto the
  donor's base angle — a moderate +value dips the camera below the floor, which is see-through from under).
  **Tier (ii) SHIPPED (in-game proven 2026-06-10):** full from-scratch opening-camera SWEEP authoring via
  `[[scene.camera_keyframes]]` (`battle/camera_codec.py` — the offset-table repack mirroring `UpdateBSC`).
  Authored in FF9's REAL opening grammar (surveyed 6 donors w/ `tools/dump_battle_camera.py`): an instant
  establish pose → 2-4 chained `CAMMOVE` segments → the donor's `SAVE_FOR_FIXED|SetCameraPhase(1)` HANDOFF
  (kept verbatim — without it the battle hangs in the intro). **The origin matters as much as the motion:**
  battle centre = world origin, default cams ~4500-5900w out → 1 distance unit ≈ ~450-500 world (not the
  comment's 63), and camera distance is measured FROM THE TARGET — so keyframes ADJUST the donor's PROVEN
  settle pose (yaw/pitch/roll OFFSETS + `zoom` multiplier) rather than absolute world poses: offset 0/zoom 1
  == the game's normal framing (can't mis-origin/super-zoom), and the final keyframe becomes the battle's
  normal camera (SAVE_FOR_FIXED snapshots where the sweep ends). **All battle frontiers cracked** (tier i
  in-place + tier ii sweep). Full recipe + the origin/scale gotchas: memory `project-ff9-battle-backgrounds`.
  Dev/test moved to the scratch id band (§3): battle-bg = field 30001, battle scenes 30010-30019.
- **Battle-map Blender loop** (add-on `0.9.7`; **in-game verified 2026-06-10** — a reshaped BBG_B013 arena
  rendered in a real Evil-Forest battle) — closes the one CLI-only gap in the battle pillar: visually reshape
  a 3D battle map. Added `parse_fbx` (the inverse of `emit_fbx`) to `battle/fbx.py` — `emit_fbx(parse_fbx(
  text)) == text` byte-for-byte on the real 8-geometry BBG_B209 (kit test). The add-on **Import Battle Map**
  parses a `BBG_B###.fbx`/`battle.toml` into editable Group_0/2/4/8 meshes (textured for preview); **Export
  Battle Map** re-emits the engine-faithful FBX (PSX group shaders + Mesh-typed nodes set in-FBX — NOT
  Blender's native exporter, which loses them), keeps the textures, scaffolds a `battle.toml`. bpy-free core
  (`bridge.group_to_blender_meshdata` / `blender_meshdata_to_group`, reusing the field's y↔z map) is fully
  tested (verts/UVs/tris/textures round-trip on real geometry); normals are Blender-recomputed on export, UV
  seams not preserved (geometry-first). The emitter `battle/fbx.py` is now vendored (`vendor/battle_fbx.py`)
  with a drift guard. **Two gotchas found in testing:** (1) Export forces **Object Mode first** + guards the
  UV read by `len(uvl.data)==len(mesh.loops)` — in Edit Mode the object-mode UV data reads size-0 while loops
  exist, so reading it IndexErrors; (2) the `_mint_toml` template is an f-string, so literal `{}` in the
  camera-keyframes prose was a SyntaxError that only the (game-data-gated) CLI path hit — now reworded +
  guarded by a pure test. To VERIFY a BBG override you must fight a battle that uses **that bbg**: field 5000's
  encounter pointed at scene 5510 (BBG_B209, an EF geometry-fork — looks like Evil Forest but isn't B013), so
  the override only shows on a real scene-67 Evil-Forest battle (re-point via the bbgprobe field). 494 kit +
  58 Blender tests pass.
- **Creature pillar + debug arena** (in-game verified) — place a battle **monster** as a field object by
  name: **`[[npc]] archetype = "zaghnol"`** / `"lich"` / `"griffin"`. The **`CREATURES`** catalog
  (`archetypes.py`, merged into `names()`/`resolve()`) holds field-RENDERABLE `GEO_MON` models (verified
  in-game — they render + animate as field objects; most also appear in shipping field scripts, a few are
  battle bosses the kit can still place); named in-game via the gallery
  loop (`tools/build_archetype_gallery.py --arena --group MON`, 4/batch — they're huge). **COMPLETE: all 21
  field-creature models named** (lich/ramuh/soulcage/ralvuimago/silver_dragon/zaghnol/red_dragon/antlion/
  griffin/catoblepas/mistodon/behemoth/mu/…), token decodes + JP origins in comments; battle-only models
  that DON'T render (e.g. `DDD`) go in the gallery's `SKIP` set. The **arena** (`tools/build_debug_arena.py`) is a big flat **scrolling
  checkerboard** debug stage for staging huge models without obstruction — pure-stdlib perspective
  checkerboard (`scene/placeholder.write_placeholders`, auto-aligned via `cam.to_canvas`) + a flat walkmesh
  + a scrolling camera, with **pitch-compensated** cells (world cells made ~1/sin(pitch) DEEPER so they read
  square on the tilted floor); the gallery `--arena` flag stages a batch on it, ~1 screen per model.
- **Info Hub spine** (`ff9mapkit/infohub.py`, + `test_infohub.py`) — the UI-agnostic discovery CORE for the
  planned user-facing viewer: `browse(query, kinds)` (cross-kind search over every catalog + the archetype/
  prop/creature/composite tables -- matched on names + comment DESCRIPTIONS + friendly aliases, so 'box' -> shelf
  and 'zidane' -> the ZDN model), `detail(entry, usage_fn=None)` (model + full anims + the auto-resolved 5
  movement slots + composite parts + aliases + the field.toml snippet; `usage_fn` = an injected hook for
  real-FF9 field-locations, so the spine stays install-free), `snippet(entry)` (the `[[npc]]`/`[[prop]]`/
  `give_item`/`[encounter]` block), `find(name, kind)`. All plain dataclasses (Tkinter/web/CLI/JSON). Built
  spine-first ON PURPOSE so a standalone viewer NOW + the **Campaign Editor** suite LATER (+ Blender if ever)
  reuse the same core with no rework. **Frontend:** `apps/ff9_infohub.pyw` (opened from the `apps/ff9_studio.pyw`
  launcher) — a standalone Tkinter window
  (live search/filter, detail pane, copy-snippet; `--smoke` self-test), the first view on the spine
  (user-verified), now with a **Preview in-game** button -- `spine.preview_field_toml(selection)` builds a
  gallery on the **`ff9mapkit/scene/arena.py`** stage (the arena builder, lifted out of `build_debug_arena.py`
  so the package can stage a preview) and deploys it to the test slot -> F6 reloads to see it live, plus a
  **Where in FF9?** button (`detail(usage_fn=...)` via `tools/model_field_usage`, cached) listing the real
  fields that place the selected model -- on-demand so browsing stays install-free. **The Info Hub pillar is
  feature-complete** (spine + viewer: search by name/description, detail, copy-snippet, preview, where-in-FF9).
- **Campaign Editor — Phases 1-3 (the IDE shell):** **Phase 1 (catalog picker, GUI-verified)** -- the Logic
  Editor's name fields gain a **Browse...** button opening a modal Info Hub picker (`ff9mapkit/editor/picker.py`,
  over the spine) that writes the chosen name back -- no more blind typing (a `forms.Field.catalog` hint
  drives it; on NPC **preset** + choice **give_item**). **Phases 2-3 (the IDE window, offline-verified)** --
  the editor/build/infohub apps were refactored to mount on a parent frame (not own `tk.Tk()`; standalone
  launchers preserved), and **`apps/campaign_editor.pyw`** tabs all three over one root (Logic Editor / Info
  Hub / Build & Deploy); the `ff9_studio` launcher offers it as the all-in-one. **Phase 4** (the multi-field
  campaign/project model: linked fields + a gateway graph) remains. 487 tests pass; the spine↔editor reuse
  is the payoff of building spine-first.
- **Campaign-import pipeline (Pillar D, field-chain) — P1–P5, in-game proven** (`ff9mapkit/chain.py` +
  `campaign.py` + `tools/deploy_campaign.py`; commits `ade57d2`..`bd6803d`). Import a connected SLICE of the
  real game and rebuild it as a custom campaign: **`import-chain <seed> --zones <z> --out <dir>`** BFS-walks
  the field graph (zone-bounded, via the `scan_all_warps` walk-in/scripted/overworld taxonomy), forks each
  field, and **RETARGETS** its in-chain gateways from real ids to the chain's own band (`id_remap` at the
  single gateway-emit site; out-of-chain exits become commented seam stubs). **`build-all`** compiles every
  member into one drop-in mod; **`lint-campaign`** does structural + cross-field GLOB-flag checks;
  **`deploy_campaign.py --apply`** installs the whole set reversibly (ONE snapshot + wholesale replace — the
  `install_tworoom` model, NOT deploy_field's per-id line-merge, which sibling-clobbers). **Proven:** the Ice
  Cavern (fields 300–312 → 30100–30111) walked in-game via F6→Warp. This realizes the Campaign-Editor "Phase 4"
  multi-field model flagged above. **textid gotcha** (cost a debug cycle): a member's FieldScene textid (6th
  DictionaryPatch token) MUST already be a key in `FF9DBAll.MesDB` or `DataPatchers` SKIPS the whole scene
  (`DataPatchers.cs:392`) → absent from F6; empty forks keep the kit default **1073** (a real block), never a
  per-member id. **New-Game-into-a-campaign with a full party is still unsolved** (the 70→100→entry route
  crashes on field 100; deploy with `--no-warp` and reach the chain via F6→Warp). Docs:
  `ff9mapkit/docs/CAMPAIGN_IMPORT.md` + `GLOBAL_RESOURCES.md`. Dev slot: `overworld` worktree → `FF9CustomMap-ow`,
  scratch field **30003**, campaign band **30100+**.
- **Jump-navigation pillar (Ice Cavern ledge/gap hops) — in-game proven 2026-06-10** (field 30101; commit
  `35d194b`). FF9's navigable jumps decoded byte-for-byte from field 301: a **region** (the ledge) `RunScriptSync`s
  the **player's verbatim jump-arc function** (`TurnTowardPosition → RunJumpAnimation → SetupJump(x,y,z) → Jump
  → RunLandAnimation → SetPathing`) — perspective-tuned world coords, **copy-only like a ladder climb**. The
  fork dropped them because `scan_ladders` matched only player-UID 250 but Ice Cavern dispatches via the player
  **entry index**; the clean ladder-vs-jump discriminator (full-game census: **181** jump-bearing fields) is the
  **ladder flag** `AddCharacterAttribute(4)` — ladders have it, jumps don't. New: `eventscan.scan_jumps` (region-
  gated, `action`/`tread`, disjoint from the now-flag-strict `scan_ladders`); **`[[jump]]`** content section +
  `content/jump.py` (synthesized region + verbatim arc graft + a one-time `SetJumpAnimation` splice — the fork's
  player is always Zidane, model 98/93); import emits `[[jump]]` + `.jump.bin` sidecars, build consumes + lints.
  **24** of the 181 are this region-gated navigable kind (the rest are cutscene/scripted jumps, correctly
  excluded). **Surfaced + fixed a latent ceiling:** the blank-field `.eb` template ships a **10-slot** entry
  table, but a 6-jump screen overflows it → `eb/edit.grow_entry_table` + auto-growing `append_entry`/`first_free_slot`
  (fields that fit in 10 stay byte-identical — hut golden preserved; real fields run to ~30 entries). Held until
  in-game confirmation, then committed (the "run the branch like the others" cadence).
- **Campaign in the Build & Deploy GUI** (`apps/ff9_build_gui.pyw`; commit `957b8da`, offline-verified) — the
  window auto-detects a `campaign.toml` (a `[campaign]` table) and re-skins: a **Deploy campaign** panel
  (reversible whole-chain install via `deploy_campaign.py`, or Build-only to `dist/`; `lint_campaign` on Check;
  `revert_campaign.py` on Revert; an experimental "Wire New Game entry" checkbox), vs the unchanged
  test-4003/game/other field flow. A banner shows the detected kind (campaign name, field count, id range, mod
  folder). Same App-on-parent contract, so it still mounts as the Campaign Editor's Build tab.
- **Battle deploy in the Build & Deploy GUI** (in-game proven 2026-06-10) — extends the campaign auto-detect
  above with a THIRD kind: the window also recognizes a `battle.toml` (a `[battlemap]` table) and re-skins to a
  **Deploy battle map** panel. **Check battle** runs `validate_battle` in-process (classifies override / repoint
  / MINT); **Build / Deploy battle** shells out to the proven `tools/deploy_battle.py <toml> [--trigger-field N]`
  (cwd=repo-root so the WORKTREE's code runs, not the editable install's); **Revert battle** runs the latest
  `tools/scroll_out/revert_battle_*.py`. It reads `.ff9deploy.toml` for the worktree mod folder, and the optional
  **Trigger field** hint lists the fields actually deployed in that folder (from its DictionaryPatch) — so you
  pick a real repoint target, not the reserved slot id. `detect_kind` → field/campaign/battle; the shared
  Check/Build-Deploy/Revert buttons relabel per kind; `--smoke` self-test added. Same App-on-parent contract
  (still mounts as the Campaign Editor's Build tab). **Provenance fix landed alongside:** `deploy_battle.py`'s
  `backups/*.preBATTLE.*` + `backups/battle_predeploy.*/` snapshots (SE-derived forked raw16/raw17/eb/mes) were
  not gitignored — now they are (mirrors the `preDEPLOY`/`preSCROLL` rules), closing a latent `git add -A` leak.
- **Campaign Editor "Phase 4" — the Campaign WORKSPACE (Phases A+B+C, offline-verified; awaits a human GUI
  click-through)** — turns `apps/campaign_editor.pyw` from three unrelated tabs into a project IDE. **Phase A
  (the pure offline foundation):** `campaign.campaign_graph(plan)` resolves a CampaignPlan into a navigable
  graph — each member with its in/out live doors (to member NAMES, not raw ids), onward seams, reachability
  from the entry, dead-ends, and dangling-edge/seam detection; `campaign.render_graph(plan)` is the text view
  (the post-fork twin of `chain.render`, wired to **`lint-campaign --graph`**); the **Info Hub spine** gained an
  optional `campaign_context` on `browse`/`detail` so a campaign's members are searchable as `kind="field"`
  entries (door/seam/reachability facts) — fully backward-compatible (no-context path byte-identical, `KINDS`
  unchanged). **Root-cause fix found en route:** `load_campaign` passed seams through raw, so loaded seams kept
  the TOML key `from` while in-memory seams use `frm` — silently dropping them from any graph view + nulling
  `lint_campaign`'s seam messages; now normalized like edges already were. **Phase B (the workspace shell):** a
  left-hand **member navigator** (ttk.Treeview) wraps the existing three tabs (the approved "project sidebar"
  UX); **Open Campaign…** loads a `campaign.toml`, populates the tree with per-member flags (entry / needs-art /
  unreachable / dead-end via `campaign_graph`), and auto-lands on the entry member; clicking a member opens its
  `field.toml` in the Logic Editor via a new public **`EditorApp.open_path()`** (the SINGLE load entry point —
  the toolbar Open routes through it too). open_path gained a **dirty-gated save guard** (`_mark_clean`/`_dirty`
  via a deepcopy `doc.data` snapshot taken on load/new/save): switching members prompts to save ONLY when there
  are real edits, so clean navigation never nags (the old Open silently discarded). **Phase C (graph view + live
  lint, all in the workspace):** the member tree is now also the GRAPH — each member expands to its live doors
  (`→ MEMBER (entrance N) [gated]`) + onward seams, and clicking a door JUMPS the editor to the target member;
  a **Check** button runs `lint_campaign` and reports errors/warnings in a workspace log (decoupled from
  navigation — it `see()`s the first problem but never selects/opens it, so checking can't pop a save prompt);
  and in the Logic Editor a member's gateway shows a read-only **`→ leads to campaign member: NAME`** hint
  (via an optional `EditorApp.campaign_idmap` the workspace sets; standalone editing unaffected). **Hardened by
  three adversarial review passes** (find→verify workflows): fixed tolerant `entrance` coercion + `dangling_seams`
  tracking/render/lint parity (A), duplicate-member-name handling (a new `lint_campaign` error + a defensive
  navigator guard against a TclError) + the entry-member double-open on load (B); Phase C's pass came back clean
  (the `to`-int lookup, standalone safety, and theme-palette keys all verified correct). All offline-testable:
  `--smoke` covers navigation + graph children + edge-nav + Check + the dirty gate both ways; **551 kit tests
  pass**. Scope was **A–C** (navigate + validate imported campaigns, text/tree graph first) and is **DONE**; the
  only deferred frontier is the visual node-link diagram (optional follow-up). (The navigator's member name is the
  structural campaign id that edges/seams key on; the editor's "Name" is the field's in-game name — decoupled by
  design, so a true member RENAME is the Phase-D op below, NOT a field-name edit.)
- **Story-flag research (Pillar: Resources / `gEventGlobal`) — `story_flags` branch** (2026-06-10;
  `research/`). Mapped FF9's save-persistent story-flag heap end-to-end: `EventState.gEventGlobal` (Byte[2048],
  Base64 in the save JSON) holds the **ScenarioCounter** (UInt16 @ bytes 0-1, master story-progress 1..12000),
  **~1051 bit-flags** (bits 184..8511), and word-counters; field scripts touch it via the `0x05` expression
  opcode (`0xC0|(VariableType<<2)|VariableSource`; Bit indexes BITS, Byte/Int16/UInt16 index BYTES). Built an
  **empirical census** (`research/flag_census.py` → reads every real field's `.eb` from p0data, decodes every
  GLOBAL var byte-exact vs `EBin.getVarOperation`): **676/676 fields, 0 errors**; the decoder self-validated by
  rediscovering the engine's worldmap cursor bytes (92-102) and `IsEikoAbducted` (SC 9860-9989 = Desert Palace).
  **★ Headline finding (verified):** real FF9's **treasure-chest "opened" bitfield is bits 8376-8511** (bytes
  1047-1063, 48 chest fields) — which **OVERLAPS the kit's campaign flag band** (`campaign.py` `flag_base=8300`,
  64/field → field index ≥1 aliases real chest bits → save corruption). Latent (the per-field allocator isn't
  wired yet) but guaranteed once it is. **Fix: the first provably-clear base is bit 8512** (max real-used bit =
  8511; safe cap 122 fields below the choice-scratch at byte 2040). **Byte 23 (bits 184/191) is an active engine
  menu/transition handshake, NOT a story flag** (rewritten every `Main_Init`; must avoid). Deliverables (all in
  `research/`, no kit code changed): **`STORY_FLAGS.md`** (the report — heap map, the 5 verbs view/understand/
  name/create/recreate, the safe-band fix, prioritized toolkit work), `CENSUS_DIGEST.md`, **`flag_catalog.toml`**
  (named-flag registry seed: engine vars + reserved regions + scenario milestones + empirical clusters + safe
  bands), + the reproducible tools. The 5-verb gaps: kit has no name registry, no save-file viewer, no seed/
  recreate — designs sketched. Done via an `ultracode` workflow (4 dossiers → adversarial verify → synthesis).
  **Safe-band fix LANDED (same branch):** `build._FlagAlloc` threads an optional per-member `flag_base`
  through `build_script`/`lint_logic` (default `None` = historical 8000/8100/8200 bands → single-field builds
  BYTE-IDENTICAL; campaign members get `flag_base + i*K`); `campaign.py` default `flag_base` 8300 → **8512**
  (`FIRST_SAFE_FLAG`, clear of the chest band); `lint_campaign` errors on any block/explicit-flag in 8376-8511
  or ≥ bit 16320. Single-field builds stay byte-identical (golden preserved). Memory: `project-ff9-story-flags`.
  **NAME + VIEW landed (report recs #2/#3):** `ff9mapkit/flags.py` is the canonical flag registry (engine named
  vars + reserved bit regions + scenario milestones + the safe-band constants — now the single source of truth;
  `campaign.py` imports them). Authoring: a **`[[flag]]`** table (`name` + `index` in [8512,16320)) + a load-time
  resolver (`resolve_project_flags`) so any `requires_flag`/`set_flag`/`flag` takes a NAME, resolved
  byte-identically to the int (test-proven); campaigns share cross-field names via a `campaign.toml` `[[flag]]`
  table (lint-checked clear of the per-member auto blocks). New CLI: **`ff9mapkit flags`** (browse the registry)
  + **`flags-inspect <save>`** (decode a save's `gEventGlobal`: ScenarioCounter+beat, FieldEntrance, TH points,
  chest count, story bits by region; reads the open JSON/Base64 form). **In-game F6 "Story state" readout
  (proven 2026-06-10):** the F6 → Flags tab shows a live ScenarioCounter+beat / FieldEntrance / TreasureHunter
  pts (engine's own `GetTreasureHunterPoints()`) / chests-opened, plus a region label on Get
  (`Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs`, patch `s22-debug-menu-f6.patch` regenerated). Real-save playtest at Alexandria Castle
  (SC 7200) **corrected the scenario→beat table** — the old ~11 anchors mislabelled mid-game; now a
  census-grounded **43-area progression** (`research/gen_scenario_table.py` → `flags.SCENARIO_MILESTONES`,
  mirrored to the C# menu) reads 7200 → "Alexandria Castle".
  **RECREATE landed (rec #4, in-game proven 2026-06-10):** `ff9mapkit save-edit <SavedData_ww.dat>`
  (`ff9mapkit/save.py`) sets a chosen slot's ScenarioCounter + flags. **Save codec cracked:** `SavedData_ww.dat`
  = a container of 18432-byte **AES-256-CBC** blocks (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 1000 iters, salt `[3,3,1,4,7,0,9,7]`,
  password = literal `"System.Security.SecureString"` — the `SecureString.ToString()` quirk IS the key);
  each block = `"SAVE"` + schema values; gEventGlobal is a String4K (2048B→2732-char base64), swapped in place
  (AES-CBC bijection → byte-exact, no checksum). **★ Playtest finding:** Memoria ALSO writes an UNENCRYPTED
  per-slot `SavedData_ww_Memoria_{slot}_{save}.dat` holding the AUTHORITATIVE gEventGlobal and restores from it
  on load (overriding the vanilla block) → `save-edit` patches BOTH; an offline-edited save loaded to "SC 2500
  → Ice Cavern" with no relaunch. Needs `pycryptodome` (lazy import). **All 5 verbs done**
  (view/understand/name/create/recreate). Dev engine stock `6b8bb2d5` + s22 (story-state view).
  **UNDERSTAND-layer deepening (the "meaning" pass, offline-verified 2026-06-10):** deepened the thinnest verb
  via a field-granular census×manifest join (`research/gen_understand_layer.py` → `understand_layer.json`),
  curated + adversarially verified by the **`ff9-understand-layer`** workflow (3 lenses: story-order /
  label-accuracy / curation + 2 research agents → synthesis). Landed in `flags.py` (602 tests pass): (1) the
  **scenario→beat table rebuilt 43→52 anchors, field-grounded** — each traces to its setter field + manifest
  room, fixing real mislabels (5900 "Iifa Tree"→**Fossil Roo**, 9990 "Outer Continent"→**Mount Gulug**, 9400
  "Hilda Garde"→**Blue Narciss**, 11610 "Crystal World"→**Memoria**) and restoring lost beats (Burmecia 3800,
  Oeilvert 9605, Water Shrine, Pandemonium 10930); 7200→Alexandria Castle preserved; mirrored to the F6 C#
  (`MsVal`/`MsName`, patch `s22` regenerated + engine rebuilt — **in-game proven 2026-06-10:** F6 reads
  7200→Alexandria Castle (real save) + 5900→Fossil Roo (throwaway, was "Iifa Tree")). (2)
  **`flags.STORY_REGIONS`** — 18 informational (non-reserved) named flag clusters annotate a decoded save's set
  bits by dominant writer area (`lindblum_events`, `mognet_central_state`, …); **reconciled a report error** (the
  "Lindblum festival @ 304-335" claim is wrong — those bits are the prologue; real Lindblum events are 2592-2663;
  the Hunt score is the separate `HuntFestivalScore` words 314/316). (3) **two engine-grounded discovery bits
  named** (815 Mognet Central, 814 Chocobo's Paradise; `WorldConfiguration.cs`). **Engine-reader pass
  (2026-06-10):** scanned every `gEventGlobal[<const>]` read in the Memoria source (47 sites/15 files) → **9 new
  tier-(a) `NAMED_WORDS`** whose meaning is the engine's own var name: NaviMode@100, WorldmapTransport@102
  (0=foot/8=Invincible), VegetableItemUsed@181, MoveControl@190, TonberiCount@192, SummonRay@193,
  SummonAllLong@207, MagicDisabledFlag@227 (= the census "Oeilvert" bit 1816, Oeilvert's anti-magic; folds that
  story cluster into the word) + split Garnet summon into Depress@17/Summon@18. A decoded save now reports e.g.
  "WorldmapTransport = 8 (Invincible)". **★ Report open-Q #1 RESOLVED —
  negative:** ATE seen-state is **NOT in gEventGlobal** — it lives in `AchievementState.AteCheck` (`Int32[100]`,
  key `AteCheckArray`), ATE selection a per-field `.eb` branch via the hardcoded `EMinigame.MappingATEID` switch →
  no heap "ATE flag index" exists (`flags.ATE_STATE_LOCATION`). **Open-Q #3 confirmed intractable:** every chest
  bit 8376-8511 has exactly 48 writers (computed index, not per-chest-static) → band stays reserved. Standing
  frontier = the per-flag-meaning dictionary for the ~1900 un-annotated heap bytes (cluster names are
  dominant-writer inference, not proven per-bit lore).
- **Campaign Editor — Phase D: authoring (create / mutate a campaign), on the story-flags safe-flag base
  (offline-verified; awaits a human GUI click-through + one in-game flag-isolation playtest)** — the from-scratch
  twin of import-chain (which forks a real region), landed AFTER + rebased onto the story-flags work above.
  **D1 — mutation/creation API** (`campaign.py` P6 section): `new_campaign` (empty manifest; default
  `flag_base = FIRST_SAFE_FLAG` from `flags.py`), `add_field` (a BLANK room via `pack.new_project` offline, OR
  FORK a real field by id/FBG-name — needs the game), `remove_field` (drops the member + subdir, prunes its
  edges/seams), `rename_field` (renames the subdir + toml_rel + rekeys edges/seams/entry; structural only — the
  field's in-game `[field] name` stays the Logic Editor's to own), `set_entry`, `add_edge`/`remove_edge`. Ids are
  **next-free** (`max+1`; never renumbered, so no member's retargeted gateways are rewritten); every mutation
  re-renders campaign.toml so the manifest stays the lossless source of truth. **D2 — flag isolation IS the
  story-flags branch's `build._FlagAlloc`** (the bullet above): Phase D's authoring sits on it — `build_campaign`
  sets each member's `flag_base` so its auto chest/event/cutscene/choice flags pack into a disjoint, census-safe
  block (clear of real-FF9 chest flags 8376-8511); single-field output stays byte-identical. Phase D ADDS a
  build-time **overflow guard**: a member with more auto once-flags than its block holds now raises `BuildError`
  instead of silently aliasing the next sub-band (`_FlagAlloc` packed but didn't guard). **D3 — the authoring
  GUI**: workspace buttons New… / + Field / Rename / Remove / Set Entry over D1 (CLI parity: **`new-campaign`** +
  **`add-field`**), refreshing the navigator and keeping the editor off a removed/renamed member. **Hardened by a
  4th adversarial review pass** (28 agents): the overflow guard above + **path-traversal guards** (a crafted/stale
  `toml_rel` can't `rmtree`/rename/read outside the campaign — `_within`/`_safe_member_dir` + member-name
  validation) + a duplicate-member-name lint error + an `id_base` prompt on New Campaign. `--smoke` covers
  add/rename/remove; the full kit suite passes. **The one thing I can't self-verify**: runtime flag isolation —
  loot a chest in member A, confirm member B's chest is NOT pre-looted — needs an in-game playtest. **Phase D
  done → the whole Campaign-Editor "Phase 4" arc (A–D) is complete.**
- **Seamless field forks — studied Moguri → the NATIVE fork (in-game proven 2026-06-10).** An `--editable`
  `.bgx` fork had two bugs the human hit forking the Dali storage room (UDFT **field 122**, area 8, the
  box-jumps): the player drew UNDER the boxes, and tile **seams**. Root-caused from `BGSCENE_DEF.cs`: FF9
  occludes the player per 16px TILE (each sprite quad at its own `depth`, `:1742`/`:1846`), but a `.bgx`
  "memoria image" overlay is ONE flat quad per PNG, and the kit (mirroring Memoria's own lossy `.bgx`
  exporter `:592`) collapsed each overlay to `min(sprite.depth)` → the box drew at its nearest tile. **`.bgx`
  fix:** split each overlay into one sub-PNG **per distinct tile depth** (`extract._depth_groups` +
  `bgs.tile_box`), depth-bucketed to cap the layer count, + **edge-bleed** opaque layers (`_edge_bleed`) —
  because `.bgx` PNGs load **Bilinear** (Unity default; the `.memnfo` `FilterMode Point` hook is dummied), so
  a cut tile bleeds to transparent = a seam. That made occlusion correct + seams "better but still there".
  **The faithful answer (studied Moguri):** Moguri ships the **vanilla `.bgs` verbatim** (per-tile depth
  untouched) + a **high-res atlas**, and **NO `.bgx`**. `BGSCENE_DEF.LoadResources` (`:821`) picks the path by
  one rule — **a `.bgx` exists → bilinear memoria path (SEAMS); else → native `atlas.png`+`.bgs` (point-
  sampled, per-tile depth = NO seams)**. So the `.bgx` is what forces seams. New kit mode **`import <field>
  --native`** (`extract.write_native_project`, build.py native branch gated on `[field] bgs`): ship
  `atlas.png` + `<FBG>.bgs.bytes` (copied verbatim) + custom `.bgi`, NO `.bgx`, area remapped ≥10 (so it forks
  **area<10** fields BG-borrow can't). **TileSize gotcha:** the atlas must match the active `TileSize`
  (Memoria.ini; vanilla 32 / Moguri 64) — a 32px atlas at TileSize 64 garbles. `extract._native_atlas` sources
  the atlas from the **active mod stack** (`_mod_folders` → scan each mod's p0data for the field's `atlas.png`),
  picking the one that fits at the active TileSize → a Moguri player gets Moguri's 64px atlas, seamless. **All
  four in-game confirmed on field 122: seams gone, Moguri high-res art, occlusion correct, snappy load.** The
  `.bgx` per-tile+bleed path stays as the REPAINT tool. → memory `project-ff9-novel-bg-pipeline`,
  `project-ff9-import-fidelity`. Dev slot: `overworld` → FF9CustomMap-ow / field 30003.
  **Wired into the campaign import (in-game proven 2026-06-10):** `campaign.write_campaign` + `add_field`
  now fork area<10 members as `--native` (was `--editable`/`.bgx`), so an imported campaign renders seamless
  end-to-end — and native needs no in-game `[Export]`, so those members never degrade to logic-only stubs
  (`needs_export` now only for a truly atlas-less field). The mod-atlas scan is cached (`_load_mod_bundle`)
  so a 13-field fork loads Moguri's bundles once. Build GUI + `deploy_campaign` handle native members
  transparently (scene-dir summary counts native+editable). **Re-forked Ice Cavern (30100-30112, 13 native
  members, 0 stubs) confirmed clean in-game** — the texture seams the human first reported there are gone.
- **Named story flags in the GUI (offline-verified; awaits a human GUI click-through)** — surfaces the
  story-flags branch's named-flag system in the Campaign Editor so cross-field gates are authored by NAME, not
  raw bit index. **F1 — author shared flags:** `campaign.add_flag` / `remove_flag` manage a campaign's `[[flag]]`
  table (the cross-field gates); `add_flag` auto-allocates the next safe index ABOVE the per-member auto-flag
  blocks (in `[FIRST_SAFE_FLAG, CHOICE_SCRATCH_FLOOR)`), rejects a dup name/index or the chest band; a workspace
  **Flags…** modal lists/adds/removes them. **F2 — pick & use names:** the Info Hub spine gained a `kind="flag"`
  (the open campaign's `[[flag]]` via the Phase-A `campaign_context` hook), wired to a **Browse picker** on the
  Logic Editor's `requires_flag` / `requires_flag_clear` / `flag` fields (new name-tolerant **FLAGREF** kind) +
  `set_flag` (**FLAGPAIR**, name-in-slot-0); a numeric index still round-trips byte-stable. The editor's
  **Check/Build resolve campaign-shared NAMES** (`FieldProject.load(flag_names=…)` from `editor.campaign_plan`,
  set by the workspace) so `_gate_of`'s `int()` never sees a raw name. **Hardened by a find→verify review:** made
  `lint_campaign` NAME-aware (it `resolve_project_flags`-resolves each member before the cross-field check, so a
  gate on an undefined shared name is now a build-blocking error and a name-based dangling gate warns — it was
  silently skipped); graceful editor errors when a shared name can't resolve (no campaign open); and surfaced a
  malformed campaign `[[flag]]` at Check instead of swallowing it. **599 kit tests pass**; `--smoke` covers the
  shared-flag add/remove. (Pre-existing, untouched: `_collect_flags` still doesn't extract `set_flag`'s pair
  index as a producer — only the `flag` key — so set-by-`set_flag` isn't seen by the dangling check.)
- **Campaign Editor — the visual Map (node-link graph; offline-verified, human GUI-confirmed)** — the one
  deferred Phase-4 frontier (the visual node-link diagram) now ships as a **Map** tab in
  `apps/campaign_editor.pyw`, beside the Logic Editor. It draws the SAME connectivity as the left tree
  navigator, but spatially: members are nodes, live gateways are arrows (dashed when story-gated), onward
  seams are dashed stubs labeled with their outside-campaign target, with the tree's cues (green=entry,
  red=unreachable, amber=needs-art; the open member filled accent). Single-click highlights a node + a status
  line (id/mode/door+seam counts/flags); **double-click opens** it in the Logic Editor (and the open member
  stays highlighted as you navigate); wheel / shift-wheel / middle-drag pan. Built spine-style:
  **`ff9mapkit/ff9mapkit/editor/graphview.py`** is a **tk-free pure layout core** (`compute_layout` over a
  `campaign.CampaignGraph` — top-down BFS levels from the entry, unreachable members in a row below, edge
  endpoints border-clipped so arrows touch the boxes) + a `GraphView` Canvas widget on top. The pure core is
  headless-tested (`tests/test_graphview.py`: levels, unreachable band, clipped edges, gated flag, seam stubs,
  determinism, empties); the widget is covered by the campaign-editor `--smoke` (renders the graph, double-click
  opens a node, highlight tracks the open member). `_graph_open` syncs the tree selection AND opens directly so
  it works with or without the Tk event loop (open_member is idempotent if `<<TreeviewSelect>>` re-fires).
  **632 kit tests pass.** Deferred polish (only if asked): edge entrance-number labels, zoom, a force-directed
  option for dense graphs. **The whole Campaign-Editor "Phase 4" arc is now complete INCLUDING the visual graph.**
- **Info Hub — story-flag registry + save inspector (F3; offline-verified + real-save confirmed)** — surfaces
  the story-flags branch's `flags.py` in the Info Hub GUI. **(1) Registry browse:** a new `storyflag` spine
  kind makes FF9's built-in story state searchable alongside the catalogs — scenario milestones (by beat OR
  value: "ice cavern" / "2500" -> `Ice Cavern (2500)`), reserved/named bit regions (`chest_opened`,
  `worldmap_unlocks`, the byte-23 handshake), the census story clusters, named word vars
  (`ScenarioCounter`/`FieldEntrance`), and the safe custom band; detail shows location + confidence tier +
  meaning + a reserved/safe note, and Copy snippet gives the right thing per kind (a `[[flag]]` template for
  the safe band, a `save-edit --scenario N` hint for milestones, a reference comment for reserved regions).
  Distinct from F2's campaign `flag` kind (that's a campaign's own gates; `storyflag` is FF9's engine state)
  and it doesn't leak into the catalog/flag pickers (they filter by kind). **(2) Save inspector:** an "Inspect
  save…" button opens a window that decodes a save's story state via a new thin `save.inspect()` over the
  proven codec — an encrypted `SavedData_ww.dat` (one entry **per populated slot**, reusing `FF9Save`/AES), a
  Memoria plaintext extra-save, or an open save JSON / Base64 `gEventGlobal`; selecting a slot shows the full
  `flags.render_report` (ScenarioCounter+beat, FieldEntrance, treasure points, chests, story bits by region).
  **Real-save confirmed** against the user's actual save (SC 6000 Fossil Roo / 7200 Alexandria Castle / 5900
  Fossil Roo). **Save-path gotcha (cost a hunt):** FF9 Steam saves live under **`AppData\LocalLow`** (NOT
  Roaming/Local) — `…\LocalLow\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY IX\Steam\EncryptedSavedData\SavedData_ww.dat`; new
  `save.default_save_dir()` returns it (the docstring was wrong) and the inspector's Browse dialog opens there.
  Spine-first: `save.inspect`/`flags.render_report` are pure + unit-tested (encrypted-container, extra-file,
  JSON, and bare-Base64 input forms); the window is the thin GUI (covered by the viewer `--smoke`). The
  **`flags-inspect` CLI** also routes through `save.inspect` now — it reads an encrypted `SavedData_ww.dat`
  (one report per populated slot, labelled) / a Memoria extra-save / a save JSON / a bare Base64 blob (was
  open-form only); real-save confirmed per-slot. **644 kit tests pass.**
- **Faithful object carry — the verbatim `.eb` entry graft (Phases 1-4, in-game proven 2026-06-10; commit
  `86a470e` on `overworld`).** A fork now CARRIES the real field's persistent NPCs/props instead of dropping
  them — replacing the lossy player-clone emit (which rendered an imported prop as "Zidane in a barrel skin",
  upside-down) with a **verbatim graft of each object's real entry bytes** (renders byte-identical to the source
  field). It's the generalization of the ladder `sequences` graft from one helper function to a whole object
  entry + its instancing. Designed by an **ultracode research workflow** (11 agents, adversarially verified →
  `ff9mapkit/docs/OBJECT_CARRY.md`: the cross-ref remap table, the census, the save-point defer call). New
  **`eventscan.scan_objects_verbatim`** (full entry bytes, non-destructive + a classified ref map [`REF_OPS`,
  optables-verified] + `graft_safety` clean/init_only/refuse + `carry_tags` + `player_tags_needed` + `needs_d9`
  + the player-entry guard; `scan_objects` refactored to share `_read_object_init`), **`content/object.py`
  `graft_objects`** (2-pass append+remap+arm; `carry_bytes`, decoder-derived `_arg_byte_offset`, same-length
  uid/slot remap: self→new slot / player-by-entry-index→250 / sibling→new slot), **extract** `[[object]]` +
  `.objectN.bin` sidecar (or a `[[prop]]`/`[[npc]]` stub for a refused object), **build** consumes it (no-op
  without it → hut golden byte-exact). **THE LOAD-BEARING GOTCHA: the fork player has only tags [0,1]**, so an
  object that `RunScript`s a player tag ≥2 (field-122 cask tag 2 → player 24) is carried **init_only** (render
  tags graft, the interaction drops). NON-DESTRUCTIVE by design (full entry + `player_tags_needed` kept) so a
  future **donor-player-script graft** (carry the donor's player funcs onto the fork player via
  `edit.add_function`, exactly like the ladder/jump arc graft) can light up the dropped interactions.
  **In-game (field 122 → slot 30003):** cask + boxes render at accurate positions; cask Init byte-identical to
  the real field (upright). **OPEN FOLLOW-UPS (not graft bugs):** (1) field **object LIGHTING** isn't carried —
  field 122 tints its models via dedicated `SetModelColor`/`SetTileColor`/shadow CONTROLLER entries (no model of
  their own) that a blank fork drops, so grafted objects render brighter/flatter; carrying those setup entries +
  remapping their uids is the fix. (2) **Save moogle DEFERRED** — a 7-entry cluster (5 hidden + 2 STARTSEQ
  helpers) + player-object surgery + a shared `gEventGlobal` contract → un-graftable; a future
  `content/savepoint.py` synthesizes it (region + props + cosmetic jump-out). (3) sibling-closure deferred. The
  authored `[[npc]]`/`[[prop]]` player-clone path is UNTOUCHED (this is import-only). Memory: `project-ff9-object-carry`.
- **Native fork carries the field's 3D-model LIGHTING (in-game proven 2026-06-10, "stellar/near-identical";
  commit `45c6082`).** Follow-up to object carry: a forked field's 3D models rendered bright/untinted (the dim
  cave lighting gone). Root cause — the field-model lighting is the **`MapConfigData`** asset
  (`CommonAsset/MapConfigData/<EVT_name>`, `fldmcf.cs`/`MapConfiguration.LoadMapConfigData`): per-FLOOR lights +
  shadows + per-OBJECT colors applied at load. The native fork shipped its own scene (`.bgs`/atlas/`.bgi`) but
  NOT this file. (Note: the SetModelColor calls in the script are SAVE-POINT choreography, fire on save not load —
  a red herring.) **Fix: ship it VERBATIM under `EVT_<forkname>.bytes`**, exactly parallel to the `.eb` (it loads
  by the same event name; the per-floor lights key on the `.bgi` the native fork already carries verbatim). New
  `extract.extract_mapconfig` + `write_native_project` ships `mapconfig.bytes` + a `[field] mapconfig=` ref;
  `build`'s native branch writes `commonasset/mapconfigdata/EVT_<name>.bytes` (`config.mapconfig_path`); lint flags
  a referenced-but-missing file; `deploy_field` copies + reverts it. **Fixes lighting for ALL native forks.** 665
  tests pass (+3). Memory: `project-ff9-object-carry`.
- **Dialogue pillar — the READ side of FF9 field text + a dialogue editor/viewer (offline- + install-verified).**
  The kit was write-only for dialogue; this closes the loop.
  **Core** `ff9mapkit/dialogue.py` (tk-free spine): `parse_mes` (the missing `.mes` reader — exact inverse of
  `content.text.mes_entry`, round-trips `build_mes`), `scan_dialogue` (decode every dialogue-window opcode
  `0x1F/0x20/0x95/0x96` + its txid out of a field's `.eb`; tag-3 func = NPC talk; best-effort (x,z)+model
  from the Init), and `read_local_dialogue`/`read_field_dialogue` that **JOIN on txid** → "NPC → text".
  `project_dialogue` lists a `field.toml`'s authored lines with final wrapping; `collect_text_refs`/`get_text`/
  `set_text` are the GUI's tk-free edit API. **Engine fact** (Memoria `FF9TextTool.GetFieldTextFileName`): a
  field's text file is `<zone-id>.mes`, the DictionaryPatch FieldScene 6th token (1073 custom; a small id for
  a real field) — so the offline JOIN is exact; a REAL field's block is resolved via Memoria's own
  **`eventIDToMESID`** table (baked as `_fieldtext.EVENT_ID_TO_MES`, 831 entries — field 100 → mes 33),
  language picked by stopword match (`--zone-id` overrides). **★ base-game `.mes` is INDEX-IMPLICIT** — NO
  `[TXID=]` tags, the txid is the entry's 0-based position; `parse_mes` handles that + the kit's explicit form. The proven WRITE path (`text.wrap_text`/`build_mes`) is untouched → goldens
  byte-identical. **CLI**: `ff9mapkit dialogue <field.toml>` (view authored lines + wrapping), `dialogue-import
  <field>` (real install, or `--mod <built folder>` offline, `--out *.dialogue.json` SE-derived/gitignored).
  **GUI**: `apps/ff9_dialogue.pyw` (`DialogueApp`, App-on-parent) — every line in one list with a **live
  wrap preview** + speaker/tail, an Import-from-game panel; a **Dialogue tab** in the Campaign Editor that
  **shares one `FieldDoc`** with the Logic Editor (no divergence) + the Logic Editor's **"Dialogue…"** hand-off
  button + a launcher entry. **★ Offline plausibility proof (no install, in tests)**: the kit's own shipped
  hut (`release/FF9CustomMap`) decodes its `.eb`, parses its `.mes`, and joins to *"I miss you Zidane"*; and
  `scan_dialogue` decodes 30 real dialogue calls from the Alexandria field-100 `.eb` fixture. **Install-
  verified** (the human ran `dialogue-import 100`: the real Alexandria opening dialogue — "Here! You dropped
  your ticket." — in the requested language). **Viewer polish DONE** (the 3 user-flagged items, all in the
  spine): `scan_dialogue` now captures the window FLAGS; `join` is lossless (marks each line `system`/`entry`,
  honors `trust_positions`) and a new `present()` gives the clean reading view — it (1) default-hides
  non-dialogue `flags=0` **system/notification** windows (the `0x80` text-box bit is the signal; the field's
  "Error Env Play()" guard + "Received item!" popups; `--all`/the GUI "Show all" reveals them), (2) **de-dupes**
  a line shown from several funcs of ONE object (preferring the NPC-talk row; distinct objects sharing a txid
  stay separate), and (3) **drops the kit-only `@x,z`** heuristic on real-field reads (`read_field_dialogue`
  passes `trust_positions=False` — the `D9(0)/D9(4)` convention is the player-clone's, not real NPCs', per the
  player-graft cross-ref). **Field 100 now reads 30 raw → 13 clean lines.** **Re-author a fork
  (`import --dialogue`):** appends the real field's NPC lines as ready-to-use `[[npc]]` blocks (real model
  resolved by GEO name → anims auto-resolve, clean editable text, `pos=[0,0]`) for the "fork a field and
  rewrite its script" workflow (`dialogue.npc_stub_toml` + a cli hook — NO extract/build changes, decoupled
  from the active object-carry session). Emitted **commented** since a fork already carries the NPCs verbatim
  as `[[object]]` — they parallel those, uncomment + reposition + rewrite the ones you want. In-game proven via
  the kit pipeline (field 100 native fork: 2 objects carried + 7 commented stubs; lints clean). The FAITHFUL
  text-carry (ship the real `.mes` so grafted objects speak — OBJECT_CARRY.md open-risk #3) is the deferred
  follow-up, best landed with the other session's player-graft. 689 kit tests pass; `docs/DIALOGUE.md`.
- **Player-function graft — P0+P1 (scanner + policy flip; offline-verified, commit `dd8755e`* on `overworld`).**
  The next step after object carry: carry the donor's PLAYER functions (the ones a carried object's interactive
  func `RunScript`s) onto the fork player so forked stock-map INTERACTIONS fire (the field-122 cask EXAMINE, the
  box gestures) -- instead of being dropped to `init_only`. Generalizes the proven one-function jump/ladder
  `add_function` graft to N funcs. Designed by an **ultracode research pass** (13 agents, full 676-field census →
  `ff9mapkit/docs/PLAYER_GRAFT.md`). **P0 (eventscan):** `resolve_player_entries` (multi-`DefinePlayerCharacter`;
  the old `_player_entry_index` returned only the FIRST), `scan_player_funcs` (per needed tag: verbatim body + a
  7-way safety class clean|text|sibling|transitive|model|exotic|missing + the donor Init's `RunModelCode`
  ANIM-PACK loads). **P1 (policy flip):** `_graft_safety` gains `graftable_player_tags` (default empty →
  BYTE-IDENTICAL); `scan_objects_verbatim` gains `graft_player_funcs=False`; when on, an object whose only blocker
  was a player-tag ref flips `init_only → whole-entry`. **Census: closure is DEPTH-0 on the object path** (no
  walker needed), **~76% of object-referenced player funcs graftable, ~90% of GEO_ACC**; field-122 cask/boxes all
  clean. **Load-bearing GOTCHA: the blank fork player loads only one anim pack; 86% of Zidane fields load EXTRA
  `RunModelCode` packs in the donor Init the fork lacks → a grafted clip is SILENTLY unloaded** (need
  `ensure_player_anim_packs`). **P2+P3 DONE + IN-GAME PROVEN (commit `913d0d9`*; pushing the field-122 cask turns
  Zidane to face it -- the grafted turn func RUNS).** P2 = `content/player.py`: `PlayerTagAllocator` (one next-free
  allocator across the ladder-17/jump-40/object-64 bands, built AFTER the jump/ladder grafts so it sees their tags
  + slides past overflow; byte-identical for in-budget fields), `graft_player_funcs` (`add_function` each clean
  func + `ensure_player_anim_packs` splices the donor Init's `RunModelCode` packs), `remap_player_tag_calls`, and
  `object.remap_entry_refs(player_tag_remap=)` (the object's `RunScript(player,T)` arg2 -> fork tag, ONLY when arg1
  is the player -- the cask's self-call tag-30 stays verbatim). P3 = opt-in `import --graft-player-funcs` emits
  `[[player_func]]` + `.playerfuncN.bin` sidecars + flips objects to whole-entry; `build` threads the allocator +
  grafts + remaps; lint guards a dangling carried player-tag (carry_tags-aware). 697 tests pass. **GOTCHA the
  engine clarified: object func tag 2 = the COLLISION/PUSH handler** (`EventCollision.cs` `Request(obj,1,2)`; tag 3
  = talk) -- so the cask reacts to being PUSHED, not talked to. **Known: pushing the cask turns Zidane then
  control-LOCKS** (it expects the save Moogle to pop out -- the DEFERRED save-point cluster; valid, not a graft
  bug). v1 refuses text/exotic/non-Zidane/sibling funcs (objects stay init_only). **Validates the player-clone
  EXIT:** the dialogue pillar's `@x,z` NPC-position garbage
  (1073,1069) is the player-clone's `D9(0)/D9(4)` positioning convention mis-read on real NPCs (a property of the
  cloned PLAYER object, not a universal NPC convention); object carry's verbatim-entry graft -- and any native NPC
  authoring -- sidesteps it by preserving each object's OWN Init opcodes. Memory: `project-ff9-object-carry`.
  *(* hash rewritten by the rebase onto the dialogue pillar.)
- **Faithful TEXT carry — ship the donor's dialogue verbatim + remap the txids (in-game proven, commit
  `ac10f2f`).** Closes the last gap the object/player grafts left: a window the grafted/carried bytes open names a
  DONOR `.mes` txid the fork doesn't ship -> EMPTY box. Carry ships the donor's referenced field text VERBATIM
  (per language) + remaps each grafted window's txid to a fresh band, so forked interactions show the REAL words.
  The faithful counterpart to `import --dialogue` (which appends editable `[[npc]]` stubs to re-author). **In-game
  (THORC orchestra -> slot 30003): a carried NPC speaks the donor's real per-language line.** New `content/textcarry.py`:
  `collect_carry` (the txids the grafts SHOW, via `dialogue.WINDOW_OPS` -- TXID = a 2-BYTE operand, operand 2 for
  `WindowSync`/`Async` 0x1F/0x20, operand 3 for the Ex 0x95/0x96), `remap_object_windows`/
  `remap_player_func_windows` (same-length 2-byte patch via `object._arg_byte_offset`), `carried_mes_body`
  (per-language VERBATIM re-emit preserving the donor STRT/TAIL -- an empty entry stays empty, NO us-fallback),
  the gitignored `.carrytext.json` sidecar. `CARRY_BASE_TXID = 1000` (clears the census max real txid 863 + the
  authored `content.text.DEFAULT_BASE_TXID` 500 band; still a 2-byte immediate). Reads the donor's per-language
  `.mes` via the dialogue pillar's `read_field_dialogue`/`_load_field_text` + the 831-entry `_fieldtext.EVENT_ID_TO_MES`
  zone table. **Un-refuses the player graft's "text" funcs** (graftable once their words are carried: `eventscan`
  `scan_objects_verbatim(carry_text=)`, `player.graft_player_funcs(graftable_safeties=)`); `extract` emits
  `[carry_text]`; `build` merges the carried `.mes` AFTER the authored block + remaps the grafted windows post-graft;
  `cli --carry-text` (implies `--graft-player-funcs`); works on all import modes (BG-borrow now forwards the flags
  it previously dropped). Opt-in, default-off -> byte-identical (hut golden). 715 tests pass. **PROCESS NOTE: this
  was WORKFLOW-GENERATED (a "research" pass that overstepped + implemented), then INDEPENDENTLY reviewed +
  verified (code read, 715 tests re-run, own import->build->deploy->in-game). Provenance double-check still pending.
  LESSON: scope research workflows so they cannot write production code.** docs/TEXT_CARRY.md.
- **Save-point synthesis — a functional save point in a custom field (in-game proven, commit `46f96d3`).** The
  deferred capstone after the object/player/text carry arc. FF9's save point SYNTHESIZED as a press-to-interact
  region instead of grafting the real save moogle's un-graftable 7-entry cluster (hidden objects + STARTSEQ
  helpers + player-pose surgery + a `gEventGlobal` contract). **★ The functional save is a SINGLE opcode:
  `Menu(4, 0)` (`0x75`) -> `EventService.StartMenu` -> `OpenSaveMenu`** (menu enum `EventService.cs`: 1=name,
  2=shop, **4+sub 0 = SAVE**, 5=chocograph); byte-exact `75 00 04 00` vs the real Dali moogle (field 122 entry 5
  tag 3 -- whose jump-out-of-barrel / Save-Shop dialogue / `RunScriptAsync(4,250,13)` player-pose are ALL
  cosmetic). The kit's `[[savepoint]]` is the navigable cousin of `content/jump.py`'s action region (Init
  `SetRegion` / tread `Bubble("!")` / action `DisableMove; Menu(4,0); EnableMove`) -- **NO player-func graft**
  (the save is a self-contained engine call). `eb/opcodes.py menu()` + `content/savepoint.py`
  (`save_dispatch`/`savepoint_region`/`inject_savepoint(s)`) + `build.py` `[[savepoint]]` (zone 4-5 pts ->
  `quad_zone`). **IN-GAME (forked Dali room -> slot 30003, a custom field id): press action -> save menu opens ->
  save -> quit-to-title -> load -> back in the custom field; full game reload -> load -> custom field again.**
  **★ This RESOLVES the long-open "save->Continue into a custom field (id >=4000)" risk (worldmap-feasibility
  memory) -- it WORKS.** 723 tests. docs/SAVEPOINT.md. The COSMETIC barrel/moogle/jump-out is a deferred later
  layer (place a `[[prop]]`/`[[npc]]` over the zone). Memory: `project-ff9-savepoint`.
- **Provenance cleanup — the working tree now ships ZERO Square-Enix game bytes (commit `e1a8667`).** Two
  parts. (1) **Text-carry double-check** (commit `3d0dac6`): the install-gated test embedded the donor's real
  `.mes` word as an assertion -> replaced with the PROPERTY (carried text DIFFERS across us/fr/jp, no us-fallback),
  so no SE string is in the repo; the descriptive "Conductor line" doc/memory mentions softened to generic. (The
  `conductor` ARCHETYPE name in `docs/ARCHETYPES.md` is the kit's own catalog id, not game text -- kept.) (2)
  **Repo audit + removal**: ~217 SE-derived dev artifacts (sessions 1-9 scratch, predating the provenance gate,
  all unreferenced by code/tests) `git rm`'d from HEAD -- `mod/` (borrowed-grgr / custom-field clones / alex /
  NPC-injected forks), `reference/bgx-samples/`, `tools/room02_out`+`room03_out`, the SE `backups/` items (the
  Alexandria `evt_alex1` `.eb`, `EVT_CUSTOM_FIELD_001`, `field70-warp`, the HW script-export `.txt` of fields
  050/070, the borrowed-GRGR `ROOM01_BASE`/`CUSTOM_ROOM_01` geometry), AND the modified Alexandria field-100 door
  `.eb` that was inside `release/FF9CustomMap/`. **`release/FF9CustomMap/` is now 100% kit-authored** (the painted
  hut EXT/INT; the field-100 path already crashed / was off the New-Game route). KEPT: the hut everywhere
  (`release/`, `tests/fixtures/hut_*`, the hut `.eb`/`.mes`/config backups). `.gitignore` extended so none recur;
  723 tests pass. The bytes remain in old LOCAL-ONLY history (never pushed) -- a full `filter-repo` history scrub
  was offered + DECLINED (HEAD-clean is the chosen depth for a local repo). The toolkit OUTPUT was already clean
  (`extract-templates` regenerates base templates from the user's own install).
