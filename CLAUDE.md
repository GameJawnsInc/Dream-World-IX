## 1. What this project is now

It began as "add one playable custom room to FF9 (Steam, Memoria engine)." **That is
long done** — multiple fully-playable minted fields exist, verified in real gameplay.

It is now **`ff9mapkit`**: a Python toolkit + Blender add-on that compiles a declarative
**`field.toml`** into a complete drop-in Memoria mod — a brand-new FF9 field with camera,
walkmesh, painted art, NPCs, dialogue, gateways, encounters, events, story branching,
cutscenes, and ladders — and can **import/fork any of FF9's ~674 real fields**. It runs on
**stock Memoria** (the shipped mod is engine-independent; a local *dev* engine adds only an
F6 debug menu). Likely the first practical reference for FF9 custom-field authoring.

Current work is **feature expansion / research / polish + release prep**, not "ship a room."
The toolkit lives at `ff9mapkit/` (package `ff9mapkit/ff9mapkit/`, Blender add-on
`ff9mapkit/blender/`). The dev-loop tools live at repo-root `tools/`.

---

## 2. Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

- **I cannot see the running game.** After any change that should be visible in-game,
  STOP and ask the human to playtest and report. Never assume it worked because it built.
- **I cannot paint background art.** Pre-rendered backgrounds + their depth layers are a
  human/art task. (I *do* tell the human exactly where to paint via the projection math.)
- **The human owns final in-game alignment judgment.** I author the camera + walkmesh from
  math (this is solved — §7), but the human confirms it lands on the art in real gameplay.
- **Back up before editing any game/engine file** → `backups/<file>.<timestamp>`. The base
  game + the user's install are the only source of truth if we corrupt something.
- **One change per in-game test.** When a build breaks, we need to know which edit did it.
- **Commit only when the user asks. NOTHING PUBLIC** — no `git push`/remote, no PRs, no PyPI,
  no forum/Discord posts. Local commits only. (Standing instruction, repeated across sessions.)

**I CAN own, end to end:** the field event script (`.eb` bytecode, authored in Python — no
Hades Workshop), camera + walkmesh math, exits/gateways, triggers, flags, dialogue/text,
encounters + BGM + battle-bg metadata, the whole `ff9mapkit` codebase, the local Memoria
engine build, the build/deploy loop, version control, and all docs/notes.

## 3. Environment & key paths

| Thing | Path |
|---|---|
| Game install | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY IX\` |
| Live mod folder | `<game>\FF9CustomMap\` (StreamingAssets + DictionaryPatch.txt + BattlePatch.txt) |
| Memoria source clone | `C:\gd\FFIX\Memoria\` (gitignored; the engine build tree — shared, not per-worktree) |
| Memoria.ini | `<game>\Memoria.ini` (engine toggles; dev build has boosters/ini cheats) |
| Toolkit | `ff9mapkit/` — CLI `py -m ff9mapkit <cmd>` (run from the kit root so the local pkg shadows any editable install) |
| Deploy tool | `tools/deploy_field.py <field.toml> [--id N]` (default test slot = field 4003) |
| GUI / editor | `tools/ff9_build_gui.pyw` (build+deploy GUI), `tools/ff9_editor.pyw` (form-based logic editor) |
| Reference field scripts | `reference/test2/` (gitignored, 817 HW field-script exports) + `reference/field-manifest.tsv` (HW-index→field-id→name; index ≠ field id) |
| FF9 field assets | `<game>\StreamingAssets\p0data*.bin` (UnityRaw 5.2.3 bundles; UnityPy reads them — `py -m pip install UnityPy`) |

> **Git layout:** two worktrees share one install — `C:\gd\FFIX` (`master`) and
> `C:\gd\FFIX-infohub-catalog` (`infohub-catalog`). They keep separate live test fields via
> `deploy_field.py --id` (e.g. master uses 4003, a branch uses a 5000-slot) so they don't
> clobber each other in the shared `FF9CustomMap`. Reach any slot via the F6 menu's "Warp".

## 4. The dev loop (no relaunch needed)

The proven fast loop — **edit → deploy → F6**:

1. Author/edit a `field.toml` (by hand, the form editor, or a Blender export).
2. `py tools/deploy_field.py <field.toml> [--id N]` — builds + deploys reversibly into the
   custom-field test slot (default 4003 = `TESTROOM`). It sandboxes ANY field.toml into that
   id+name, reverts the slot's prior deploy, and writes a per-id `revert_deploy_<id>.py`.
3. In-game press **F6 → Reload field** (re-reads the current field's mod files from disk:
   `.eb`/`.mes`/scene/walkmesh/art) **or → Warp to field → <id>**.
4. Ask the human to verify. Each change = one commit + one in-game check.

**Relaunch is only needed for:** the FIRST deploy of a *new* id (to register its
DictionaryPatch line), a BattlePatch change, or an engine-DLL rebuild. Reverting a deploy:
`py tools/scroll_out/revert_deploy.py` (latest) or `revert_deploy_<id>.py`.

**Engine builds** (changing `Assembly-CSharp.dll`): MSBuild VS18 BuildTools, build the csproj
with **`/p:SolutionDir=C:\gd\FFIX\Memoria\`** (trailing `\` required, else mscorlib conflict).
⚠ The build **AUTO-DEPLOYS** to the game (x64+x86 Managed) with **no backup** — back up the
DLL first. Version-match: stay near the installed compile-date's `main` commit (`6b8bb2d5`).
New `.cs` files must be added to the csproj `<Compile Include>`. See memory `project-ff9-memoria-build`.

---

## 5. Current state (keep this updated)

- **Dev engine** = stock Memoria `6b8bb2d5` + the **F6 debug menu only** (`UIKeyTrigger.cs` +
  `Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs`; patch `memoria-patches/s22-debug-menu-f6.patch`). Boosters are manual
  (ini cheats + F1–F4). The *shipped* mod needs none of this — it's engine-independent.
  Revert engine → no-edits rebuild: `tools/restore_memoria_dll.py baseline`; true stock = re-run the patcher.
- **F6 debug menu** (dev build, in-field): a draggable tabbed IMGUI popup —
  **Warp** (reload field · warp to any registered custom id ≥4000) ·
  **Move** (teleport to x,z · right-click the field to copy the floor (x,z) under the cursor) ·
  **Cheats** (booster toggles · full-heal · give item/gil) ·
  **Flags** (get/set/clear a `gEventGlobal` story flag · snapshot/restore · reset-all) ·
  **Time** (0.25–4× time-scale). **This SUPERSEDES the old single-key F6-reload / F10-reset
  hotkeys — do not refer to those as current.**
- **Canonical demo content:** two painted "Vivi" hut rooms — **4000** exterior + **4002**
  interior — door round-trip, a talking Vivi NPC, an encounter, and an **Alexandria (field 100)
  door**. The clean packaged copy lives in **`release/FF9CustomMap/`** (the known-good source).
- **The live dev `FF9CustomMap` is a churned scratchpad** — test deploys overwrite/remove scene
  folders, so the hut's `FBG_N11_HUT_*` scenes are frequently absent (they are right now;
  FieldMaps holds only the test-slot scenes). **To actually play the hut, redeploy it from
  `release/`.** Registered fields: 4000 HUT_EXT, 4002 HUT_INT, **4003 = the shared test slot**
  (`deploy_field.py`, currently a CPMP ladder fork).
- **Debug New-Game warp** jumps straight to **field 4003** (entrance 11) — NOT through
  Alexandria (the route-through-100 hop was abandoned because field 100 crashes). Field **100
  (Alexandria)** holds the door wiring + known debug-hack breakage (dead `Field(4004)` + a
  spawn inside a gateway zone) — off the New-Game path now; a real story entrance would rebuild it.
- **Versions:** kit `0.9.5`, Blender add-on `0.9.6`. **Provenance gate is CLEARED** — the
  repo ships ZERO Square-Enix bytes; base templates are regenerated from the user's own
  install via `ff9mapkit extract-templates` (patches + SHA-256 manifest). `*.eb.bytes` /
  `*.bgx` / `*.bgi.bytes` are gitignored (except our own hut quad).
- **Open public item (do NOT act):** Memoria PR #1433 (FieldCreatorScene PNG-path fix) — left
  as-is, irrelevant to the toolkit. Nothing else pending; standing constraint = nothing public.

---

## 6. The toolkit at a glance (capabilities — all in-game proven)

`ff9mapkit` compiles `field.toml` → mod. The full content/scripting stack, each verified in
real gameplay and reproducible in Python (zero Hades Workshop):

- **Field & scene:** mint a custom field id (≥4000); single / **scrolling** / **multi-camera**
  cameras; human-painted art layers with depth-based occlusion; walkmesh authored from math OR
  imported/reshaped from a real field.
- **Content:** NPCs (any model + animations, by name) · dialogue (speaker tag, auto-wrap) ·
  gateways (round-trip doors) · encounters (+ field/battle BGM, after-battle fix) · **events**
  (chests / gil / story flags / triggers) · **story branching** (flag-gated NPCs / doors /
  events) · **dialogue choices** (NPC + zone, default/cancel rows, static + flag-gated hide) ·
  **cutscenes** (narration v1 + actor walk/path/turn/animation/teleport v2) · **ladders**
  (navigable, vertical/slant/bent shapes, floor/gateway/worldmap tops, re-entry).
- **Import/fork:** `ff9mapkit import <field>` (BG-borrow or `--editable` custom-scene) +
  `list-fields` — fork any of **674** real fields (camera + walkmesh + gateways/BGM/encounters
  extracted offline from p0data). Blender "Import FF9 Field" gives a visual fork→author loop.
- **Authoring surfaces:** declarative `field.toml`; the **scene.toml (Blender, spatial) /
  field.toml (logic)** split; the **form editor** `ff9mapkit edit`; the **Blender add-on**
  (camera/walkmesh/layers + NPC/gateway/event/spawn/waypoint/cam-zone markers).
- **Info Hub catalogs:** `ff9mapkit models | animations | scenes | items | catalog` — browse
  GEO models, anims, battle scenes, items, fields by name (baked from Memoria source,
  provenance-clean); the model→animation join is engine-sound.
- **Build-time validation** (offline, since I can't see the game): content off the walkmesh /
  within the collision radius of a wall, stranded floors, broken seams, zero-area triangles,
  layer aspect mismatch, camera pitch range, dead story flags, unknown model/item names.
  `ff9mapkit lint <toml>` / `ff9mapkit walkmesh verify <path>`.

Always **fork/learn from a real field's bytes** before authoring a new mechanic — every
mechanic above was grounded byte-for-byte against shipping FF9 data, not invented.

---

## 7. Hard-won facts & gotchas (load-bearing — deep recipes in §9 memory)

**Custom fields / BG**
- Mint via DictionaryPatch `FieldScene <id> <area> <MAPID> <NAME> <textid>`; custom ids ≥ 4000.
- **BG-borrow**: point `<area>`+`<MAPID>` at a real field's art. **`<area>` MUST be ≥ 10** —
  the loader builds `"FBG_N"+area` with no zero-padding and reads exactly 2 chars, so
  single-digit areas (0–9) black-screen. (`--editable` forks remap a low area to ≥10.) → `project-ff9-bg-borrow-solution`.
- Runtime always loads the compiled `.eb` (no text→.eb path). Per-language `.eb` differ ONLY
  in the 84-byte name field; **bytecode is language-identical** → byte-patch the code region at
  the same offset in all 7 langs. → `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling`.

**Camera / projection / canvas** (`project-ff9-camera-math`)
- Invariant: `R_ff9 = diag(1, 14/15, 1)·R_ortho` (vertical-focal aspect; **k = 14/15** is a
  global constant baked into orientation row 1). Author any camera from math (`cam.synth_r_t`).
- **Canvas map is EXACT scale-1**: `canvasX = rawProj.x + w/2`, `canvasY = h/2 − rawProj.y`
  (proven to 0.0005 px vs an in-engine probe). The old per-pitch `sx/sy` (0.926/0.889) were an
  eyeball fit silently absorbing constants — **dead**.
- **Character ground offset = 0** (engine-measured). The legacy `org=(0,0,300)` +
  `CHARACTER_GROUND_OFFSET_Z=298` were a near-cancelling double-count — **ripped**; new
  walkmeshes use `frame="world"` (org=0, no offset).
- `COLLISION_RADIUS_W ≈ 48` (= `bgiRad*4`): the player CENTRE can't reach a walkmesh edge —
  extend the walkmesh ~48u past the painted floor if the player should reach the visual edge.
- **Art / canvas wiring:** logical canvas **384×448**; painted PNGs are **4× upscaled** (a full
  layer = 1536×1792). An overlay's `Position` = top-left logical px (Y-down), `Size` = px/4,
  `Z` = depth (**smaller Z = in front of the character** → occlusion); overlay world placement is
  the scale-1 inverse of `to_canvas`.
- **Scrolling:** build `proj` from the visible **window width (384)** and only widen `Range` for
  a wider painting — naively widening `proj` DOUBLES the FOV (the kit's `[camera] window_width`).
- Yaw: `R = rot_x(pitch)·rot_y(−yaw)` (post-multiply keeps the origin centred). Control
  direction is auto-derived from yaw: `value = round(yaw/360·256) − 1` (front-facing = −1).
- The editor's **5-point anchor solver is degenerate for flat floors** (rank-deficient) — DEAD
  END; use the math, not the editor, for cameras.

**Walkmesh / import** (`project-ff9-import-frame`)
- A real field's walkmesh world position = **`vert + orgPos + floor.org`** (universal; multi-
  floor tiles via per-floor `floor.org`; single-floor `floor.org=0`). This is THE frame rule.
- Real `.bgi` floors are **disjoint vertex sets, corner-origin per floor.** Rebuilding neighbor
  links by shared vertex INDEX loses cross-floor seams → **ship the real `.bgi` verbatim**, or
  reshape via `obj + links` (a position-keyed seam sidecar). The `.bgi` codec is lossless; only
  the `.obj` intermediate drops adjacency.
- **`IsInQuad`/`TreadQuad` test a FAN of consecutive vertex-triplets, not the real polygon** —
  3 collinear points = a zero-area triangle = a DEAD ZONE. Use a convex quad with the last
  vertex DOUBLED. → `project-ff9-gateway-regions`.

**Regions / gateways** (`project-ff9-gateway-regions`)
- Region triggers only fire when `usercontrol == 1`. **Region tag 2 = tread** (every frame in
  the quad), **tag 3 = press-to-interact** (action button), **tag 10 = Main_Reinit** (runs after
  battle). The player must actually REACH the zone (place it where he demonstrably stands).
- Exit walk-out direction is set by the polygon's **point ORDER** (q[0]→q[1] edge first = walk
  forward, no "circle").

**Encounters / battle** (`project-ff9-encounters`)
- A field cloned from a cutscene field lacks an entry-0 **tag-10 Main_Reinit** → after-battle
  **softlock** (`EnterBattleEnd` suspends objects; nothing resumes them). Fix: add a tag-10 that
  `FadeFilter(2,16,…)` (overrides BattleResultUI's 256-frame timed fade) + re-enables move.
- BattlePatch `Music:` = the akao **song-play id** (0 = Battle Theme), NOT a file number. Field
  BGM = `RunSoundCode(0, <song id>)` (song id, not file number; Vivi's Theme = 9).

**`.eb` scripting** (`project-ff9-eb-script-tooling` — full opcode table; kit `eb/_optables.py` is authoritative)
- Format: 44B header + 84B PSX name → entry table at offset **128** (10 slots × 8B); a
  function's `fpos` is measured from `entryStart+2`; 2-byte opcodes are prefixed `0xFF`.
- Opcode traps worth memorizing: **`Battle = 0x2A`** (NOT PreloadField — encoding a warp as
  0x2A starts a battle on a bad scene id → crash/black); real `PreloadField = 0xFD` is a no-op
  HINT on Steam; `Field = 0x2B` is the real warp; **`0x01` is an undocumented unconditional
  JMP** (don't overwrite a Wait that sits right after it — the activation is skipped). Camera/
  scroll mechanics: **`SETCAM = 0x7E`** (switch active camera), **`BGCACTIVE = 0x71`** (enable
  scroll / camera-services).
- **Expression sub-language**: opcode `0x05` + a `0x7F`-terminated RPN stack; var token byte =
  `0xC0 | (type<<2) | source`. `B_SYSVAR=0x7A` (code 9 = `GetChoose`, reads the picked choice
  row); `GetItemCount` = expr fn `0x64`. Reusable for chests/levers/choices.
- **Actor cutscene choreography MUST run in the NPC's LOOP (tag 1), not its Init (tag 0).**
  `ProcessAnime` advances `animFrame` only when `obj.state == 1`; Init runs at `state == 2`, so
  Init-spliced movement updates the transform but FREEZES the skeleton (glide, no emote). Also:
  a **warm-up `Wait(~30)`** before the first actor command (entry-transition settle, else the
  walk circles + the synchronous walk hangs); `SetWalkTurnSpeed(255)` to avoid the
  walk-to-a-point-behind orbit/softlock; **never `WaitTurn`/`WaitAnimation` on a player-cloned
  NPC** (its clips don't complete those → softlock — use instant turns + a fixed `Wait(40)`);
  `MoveInstantXZY` args are `(worldX, −worldY, worldZ)` + `SetPathing(1)` after (it disables
  walkmesh collision).

**Story flags — persistence** (the bug that bit every once-gated thing)
- A var's **source** decides persistence: **GLOB (src 0) = save-backed `gEventGlobal`** (2048
  bytes, persists across field reloads + saves) vs **MAP (src 1) = per-field, WIPED on every
  field load.** HW naming is INVERTED (HW "GlobBool" = engine **Map** = transient).
- `EventContext.mapvar` is **only 80 bytes** → a high flag index in MAP space is out-of-bounds
  = hard crash. **Use GLOB for chests / story flags / cutscene-once.** The kit uses `GLOB_BOOL
  = 0xC4` (transient dev twin = `MAP_BOOL = 0xC5`) with flag bases in the **8000+** band (clear
  of base-game flags); indices > 0xFF need the long-index token encoding (`class|0x20` + 2-byte
  LE) — which is why the 8000 band works. `gEventGlobal` index N → byte `N>>3`, bit `N&7`.
- A `once=true` event/cutscene won't replay for *testing* once its persistent flag is set —
  use `once=false`, a fresh New Game, a distinct flag index, or F6 → Flags → reset.

**Dev engine** (`project-ff9-memoria-build`)
- Read dev hotkeys in a real MonoBehaviour `Update()` (e.g. `UIKeyTrigger`) via
  `UnityXInput.Input` — **NOT** `HonoLateUpdate` (the ~30 fps logical tick misses `GetKeyDown`).

**Process**
- **Hades Workshop is fully out of the loop** — its custom-field atlas clone has a systemic UV
  bug, and its export CORRUPTS entry-adds. Author `.eb` in Python (verify with `eb_disasm` /
  the kit before deploy). → `project-ff9-mint-gotchas`, `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling`.
- **Never edit a bundled example in place** — the form editor's Save will rewrite the
  byte-exact golden oracle. Author on a copy / `ff9mapkit new` / a Blender export.
- Grep alone can't prove a field is unused — FF9 cutscenes fire from C# tables
  (`NarrowMapList.cs`), not just field scripts. Trust the user's game knowledge over grep.
  → `feedback_trust_user_game_knowledge`, `project_ff9_has_no_unused_fields`.

---

## 8. Dead ends (proven — don't re-explore)

- **HW "Export as Custom Field" atlas clone** — systemic UV bug (A/B tested on two bases). Use
  BG-borrow or `--editable` custom scenes instead.
- **HW adding a new `.eb` entry** — corrupts the file (overwrites the player object). Python only.
- **The FieldCreator editor's 5-point camera anchor on a flat floor** — mathematically degenerate.
- **Encoding a field warp as opcode `0x2A`** — that's `Battle`, not PreloadField → crash/black.
- **A uniform `orgPos/2` walkmesh slide / an `f0`-vs-`+org` frame auto-detector** — the import
  frame is always `vert + orgPos + floor.org`; no heuristic.
- **Per-pitch `sx/sy` canvas scale** — the map is exact scale-1; the "back-edge drift" was the
  character collision radius, not a map error.

---

## 9. Project memory (the deep recipes)

Read these on demand — they hold the full technical detail this file only summarizes
(`~/.claude/projects/C--gd-FFIX/memory/`, indexed by `MEMORY.md`):

- `project-ff9-eb-script-tooling` — `.eb` format + opcode tables, Python injection, custom
  text/MES, the F6 debug menu, the cutscene-in-LOOP rule, flag persistence.
- `project-ff9-camera-math` — the projection invariant, decompose/synthesize, scale-1 canvas
  map, character offset, yaw, multi-camera convention.
- `project-ff9-import-frame` — the `vert + orgPos + floor.org` walkmesh frame; simple vs multi-floor forks.
- `project-ff9-novel-bg-pipeline` — painted-BG / overlay-depth / occlusion pipeline.
- `project-ff9-gateway-regions` — region trigger mechanics + IsInQuad dead zones.
- `project-ff9-encounters` — random battles + the after-battle Main_Reinit fix.
- `project-ff9-memoria-build` — local engine build toolchain + auto-deploy + version-match.
- `project-ff9-bg-borrow-solution`, `project-ff9-mint-proven`, `project-ff9-mint-gotchas` — minting + BG-borrow + HW dead-ends.
- `feedback_trust_user_game_knowledge`, `project_ff9_has_no_unused_fields`,
  `project_ff9_field_warp_pattern`, `reference_ff9_modding_community` — process + community.

## 10. Milestone timeline (the trail, compressed — full story in git)

- **S0–1** — Recon; build/test loop proven; field 1357 (Hangar) is a complete playable map.
- **S2–4** — MINT proven (custom field ids work); HW atlas clone is broken → **BG-borrow** the
  solution (real art via DictionaryPatch, area ≥10).
- **S5–8** — Novel painted BGs: borrowed-camera walkmesh, human-painted art, walkmesh↔floor
  alignment + foreground occlusion all working in-game.
- **S9** — `.eb` content authored directly in **Python** (HW dropped): NPCs, talk triggers,
  custom dialogue text (mod `.mes` at a high TXID).
- **S10** — **Camera math cracked**: author/decompose/synthesize ANY angle; exact scale-1
  canvas map; novel-angle room calibrated + walkable.
- **S11** — Two connected painted rooms (gateways) + first encounter with the after-battle fix.
- **S12** — Local Memoria engine build; fade/BGM/encounter/cold-start fixes; custom room wired
  into **Alexandria** (real-world round trip).
- **S13** — **`ff9mapkit` built** (field.toml → mod) + the **Blender add-on**; the back-edge
  anomaly cracked (scale-1 map + collision radius).
- **S14** — Blender visual authoring (camera/walkmesh/markers); bounds tests (concave, yaw);
  scene/field split begins.
- **S15** — **Scrolling fields** (BGCACTIVE) end-to-end + in the kit + Blender.
- **S16** — **Import any real field** from p0data (offline extraction); the universal walkmesh
  frame; simple + multi-floor forks; Blender "Import FF9 Field".
- **S17** — Faithful `.bgi` exporter; editable-art (occlusion-preserving) forks; multi-floor
  seam reconcile; the offline **build-time validation suite**.
- **S18** — Multi-camera (N cams, after-battle restore); the conditional-region primitive →
  **events / story branching / cutscenes** (narration + actor); the flag-persistence fix;
  character-offset measured 0; honest walkmesh.
- **S19** — Authorship suite: **form editor** + scene/field split + linter; **provenance gate
  cleared** (zero SE bytes); stock engine + F6; instant New-Game warp; release-prep docs.
- **S20–21** — Dialogue wrap + cutscene auto-pathing; modern editor UI; **dialogue choices**
  (default/cancel/hide, flag-gated); chest/reward conventions matched to real FF9.
- **S22** — **Ladder import** (shapes, top-actions, re-entry) + the warp-plumbing saga.
- **S23** — The **F6 debug menu** (supersedes old hotkeys); the **Info Hub catalogs**
  (models/anims/scenes/items) + `[[npc]] model` by name; ladder catalogue 100%.
- **InfoHub archetype pillar** (in-game verified) — `catalog.npc_anims`: place **any** of the 154
  field models as a working NPC by name, animations auto-resolved via the model→animation join
  (`[[npc]] model = "GEO_NPC_F0_BMG"`, no `anims` needed); `ff9mapkit models <name>` shows the
  NPC-ready slots. **Named archetypes** layer friendly one-word NPC types on top
  (`[[npc]] archetype = "garnet"` / `"black_mage"` / `"moogle"`; `ff9mapkit archetypes` lists them).
  Builds on the read-only catalogs to make the Info Hub a real authoring pillar.

## 11. Glossary

- **Field** — one explorable screen with a fixed-perspective pre-rendered background.
- **Walkmesh** — invisible per-floor geometry defining the walkable area + depth.
- **Main_Init / Main_Reinit** — a field script's entry function / its after-battle re-entry
  (entry-0 tag-10).
- **Gateway** — a region trigger that warps the player between fields.
- **BG-borrow vs custom scene** — reuse a real field's art (DictionaryPatch) vs ship our own
  `.bgx`+PNGs+`.bgi`.
- **field.toml / scene.toml** — the kit's logic file / Blender's spatial file (merged at build).
- **GLOB vs MAP flag** — save-persistent (`gEventGlobal`) vs per-field-transient story state.
- **F6 debug menu** — the dev-engine in-game tool (Warp/Move/Cheats/Flags/Time).
