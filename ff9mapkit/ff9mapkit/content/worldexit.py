"""The WORLDMAP exit for a synthesized field -- ``[[gateway]] to = "worldmap"``.

A field returns to the world map via ``WorldMap`` (opcode 0xB6) whose operand IS the
``wldMapNo`` (9000-9012). No real field hardcodes one target: all 79 world-exit fields
carry a **byte-identical EXIT CASCADE** (verified identical in field 300 Ice Cavern
e2/tag2 and field 2800 Daguerreo e21/tag2 -- OVERWORLD_ENGINE.md "the shared exit
cascade") that emits all 13 targets and selects by ``(ScenarioCounter band) x (region
key D8:2)``. The kit CARRIES that cascade verbatim -- extracted at build time from the
user's install (provenance-clean, like cameras; never committed) as the
instruction-aligned common suffix of the two verified carriers, self-checked to parse
cleanly and hold every WorldMap arm.

The field writes its own region key first (the same ``D8:2`` transition parameter a
``Field()`` warp uses as its arrival entrance -- ``region.set_field_entrance``).

THE ARRIVAL LAW (decoded from WORLD09 e5/tag0, the world player's Init): on world
load the Init tests ``D8:2`` -- **nonzero** loads the dispatcher's HARDCODED entry
point into the position vars (each world has one; a real exit field's key both
routes the cascade AND selects that world's door arrival), **zero** skips the
override, so ``MoveInstantXZY`` places the player from the PERSISTED position vars
(``C8:0x53``/``D8:0x56``/``C8:0x58`` -- the world player's Loop mirrors its position
into them continuously). The kit default ``region_key = 0`` therefore means "return
exactly where the player stood when they entered" -- the right semantic for a field
on kit-built land with no real-world door registration -- and it guarantees the
cascade's DEFAULT arm (**9009, the all-vehicle free-roam superset**, every SC band;
the default arm re-zeroes the key itself). The explicit 0-write matters: a STALE
nonzero key would otherwise route the cascade to another state AND teleport the
arrival to that world's hardcoded door.
