# FF9 Story-Flag System — Research Report (`ff9mapkit`, `story_flags` branch)

*Framed around five verbs: **VIEW · UNDERSTAND · NAME · CREATE · RECREATE**. Every quantitative claim
traces to the empirical census (`research/flag_census.json` / `flag_census.py`, 676/676 fields, 0 scan
errors), the Memoria C# engine, or Hades Workshop source. Produced by the `ff9-story-flag-research`
multi-agent workflow (4 parallel dossiers → adversarial verification → synthesis); corrections from the
three adversarial verdicts are applied inline.*

**Companion artifacts in this folder:**
`flag_census.py` (the scanner) · `flag_census.json` (full data) · `CENSUS_DIGEST.md` (human-readable data
appendix) · `make_digest.py` (regenerates the digest) · `flag_catalog.toml` (the named-flag registry seed
this report recommends). See `README.md`.

## 1. Executive summary

**What an FF9 story flag *is*.** All save-persistent story/event state lives in one place:
`EventState.gEventGlobal`, a **2048-byte array** (`EventState.cs:10`), serialized into the save JSON as a
single Base64 string under key `"gEventGlobal"` (`JsonParser.cs:522,579`). It is the engine's
`VariableSource.Global` space (`EBin.cs`, `enum VariableSource { Global=0, Map=1, … }`). Field scripts
read/write it through the `0x05` expression opcode using a var token `0xC0 | (type<<2) | source`, where the
index is a **bit address** for `Bit` vars (byte = `idx>>3`, bit = `idx&7`) and a **byte address** for
`Byte/Int16/Int24` vars. Three kinds of content occupy the heap:

1. **The ScenarioCounter** — a little-endian UInt16 at **bytes 0–1**, the master story-progress value
   (`EventState.cs:16-24`; engine token `SC_COUNTER_SVR = 0xDC`, `EBin.cs:34`). Census: **321 distinct
   absolute values** set, range **1..12000**, near-monotonic across discs — plus a handful of fields that
   *nudge* it relatively (`++`/`--` in 7 fields each, and a few `+=`/`*=`/`/=`/`&=`/`|=`).
2. **Bit-flags** — **1051 distinct** script-authored bits, spanning bit range **184..8511** (181 bytes of
   the heap). Once-events, door gates, location unlocks, treasure-chest "opened" state.
3. **Word-vars** — **333 distinct** Byte/Int16/Int24 values beyond byte 0, including FieldEntrance (Int16 @
   byte 2, every field) and per-area minigame/counter structures.

**State of the kit.** `ff9mapkit` already encodes flag ops **byte-for-byte** against real FF9 bytecode
(`content/region.py`), scans what each field touches offline (`eventscan.py`), allocates per-field
once-flags, lints dangling/colliding flags (`build.py`, `campaign.py`), and exposes get/set/clear/
snapshot/reset in the **F6 debug menu** (`Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs`). *Since this research:* a **named flag
registry** (`flags.py`, recommendation 2), an **offline save-file reader** (`flags-inspect`,
recommendation 3), and a **live in-game F6 "Story state" readout** (the in-game half of 3, proven 2026-06-10)
have landed. Still missing: a **seed/recreate** mechanism (recommendation 4).

**Three headline findings:**

- **★ Safe-band collision (latent, must fix before wiring).** The campaign allocator's reserved band
  (`campaign.py:182`, `flag_base=8300`, `flags_per_field=64`) overlaps real FF9's contiguous treasure-chest
  bitfield at **bits 8376–8511** (130 bits, bytes 1047–1063, written by 48 chest fields). A campaign field
  index ≥1 would alias real chest-opened bits → save corruption. The collision is **currently latent** —
  `flag_base` is reserved in `campaign.toml` but not yet threaded into `build_script` (deferred P5,
  `GLOBAL_RESOURCES.md:92`). **The first provably-clear base is bit 8512** (the census max real-used bit is
  8511). Recommend `flag_base=8512` (round: 8520/8600) before the allocator is wired.
  **✅ FIXED 2026-06-10 (this branch) — see §5(1):** default moved to 8512, per-member allocation threaded
  through `build._FlagAlloc`, and `lint_campaign` now errors on any block/flag in the chest band. 547 tests pass.
- **Byte 23 is an active engine handshake, not a free flag.** Bits 184/191 are touched by all 676 fields —
  but disassembly shows they are a per-field **menu/transition guard** (bit 184 = "in-field menu in
  progress", set bracketing `Menu` calls, re-checked and cleared in every `Main_Init`; bit 191 = a
  companion scratch bit zeroed on every boot). Re-written on every field load, gating the
  `FieldEntrance=10000` sentinel handshake. A mod must **replicate the prologue and never treat byte 23 as
  story state.**
- **The mechanism is fully documented; the *meaning* is not.** Where flags live, how they're typed, and how
  they persist is recoverable from Memoria + Hades Workshop (authoritative). But a complete value→meaning
  dictionary does **not** exist publicly — only ~15 engine-hardcoded scenario milestones and a few named
  subsystem regions. The rest must be mapped empirically (which the census now does).

---

## 2. The 2048-byte heap, mapped

Addressing reminder: a **Bit** index N → byte `N>>3`, bit `N&7`. A **Byte/Int16/Int24** index is a raw byte
offset. So "bit 184" = byte 23 bit 0, but "Int24 @ index 184" = byte 184 — a *different location* (this
exact aliasing trips up readers; see byte 23 vs. byte 184 below).

Confidence: **(a)** engine/decompilation-grounded · **(b)** corroborated community/empirical · **(c)**
single-source/uncertain.

**ScenarioCounter chapter banding (empirical, area→value).** Near-monotonic; the engine does *not* advance
it by a fixed step and disc boundaries are not round numbers (the "disc N starts at value X" forum claim is
**(c), uncorroborated** — do not bake it in). Anchors: Prologue/Tantalus 1000–1600 · Evil Forest ~2020–2400
· Ice Cavern 2500–2525 · Dali 2530–2680 · Lindblum 3000–3180 (later 9000–10100) · Burmecia 3800–3880 ·

Palace / Eiko abduction 9250–9890** · Terra 10830–10890 · Pandemonium 10930–10990 · Crystal World endgame
11610–**12000**.

## 3. The five verbs — current state & gaps

### VIEW — *see what flags a field/save touches*

- **Today:** `eventscan.py` provides four offline byte-scanners (`scan_flags_set` :459,
  `scan_required_flags` :476, `scan_edge_flag_gates` :502, decoder `_glob_var_token` :436) that report what
  each `.eb` **writes / reads / gates** — GLOB-only (0xC4/0xE4); MAP (0xC5) and UINT8 (0xD5) excluded as
  transient. The census (`research/flag_census.py`) aggregates this across all 676 real fields. In-game, the
  **F6 → Flags** tab (`Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs:457-526`) does live get/set/clear/snapshot/restore on
  `gEventGlobal`.
- **Now:** ✅ an **offline save-file reader** (`flags-inspect`) AND a **live in-game F6 "Story state" readout**
  both landed (recommendation 3) — the offline reader Base64-decodes a player's `gEventGlobal`; the F6 tab
  shows ScenarioCounter+beat / FieldEntrance / treasure points / chest count live (in-game proven). **Remaining
  gap:** the `.eb` scanners still see only the `0x05` expression path, so flags mutated by engine C# (e.g.
  worldmap-unlock consumers) stay invisible — why **276 bits read as "write-only."**

### UNDERSTAND — *know what a flag means*

- **Today:** The *mechanism* is fully reverse-engineered and documented (`GLOBAL_RESOURCES.md`): var
  encoding, GLOB-vs-MAP persistence, the byte-for-byte bytecode. The census + this report give an empirical
  region map (§2).
- **Gaps:** No "what this flag means" lore layer. ~15 scenario milestones and a few subsystem regions are
  named; the other ~1900 bytes are un-annotated. **ATE/Mognet specific indices are a genuine public gap** —
  mechanism known (engine reads `gEventGlobal` bits + ScenarioCounter to gate them), indices unnamed
  anywhere **(c)**.

### NAME — *refer to a flag by name, not index*

- **Today:** ✅ **Implemented** (recommendation 2). A `[[flag]]` table names a flag (`name` + `index`); the
  `flags.py` registry + load-time resolver let any `requires_flag`/`set_flag`/`flag` take a name, resolved
  byte-identically to the numeric form. Campaign-level `[[flag]]` defs give shared cross-field names.
- **Gaps:** The whole registry. Hades Workshop already proves the model — it names
  `General_ScenarioCounter` / `General_FieldEntrance` and lets modders attach custom names per script
  (`Gui_ScriptEditor.cpp`). Note the **HW naming inversion trap** (CLAUDE.md already flags it): HW `GlobBool`
  = engine **Map** = *transient*; HW `GenBool` = engine **Global** = *persistent*. A name-aware UI must not
  repeat "Glob = global." *(This report's `flag_catalog.toml` is a first concrete registry seed.)*

### CREATE — *author a new flag safely*

- **Today:** The kit encodes flags correctly: long-index support for >255 (`region.py:109-117`, e.g.
  `0xE4 0x84 0x20 0x7F` for idx 8300), GLOB class for persistence, gates/once-guards/choice-masks all
  grounded in real fields. Per-field once-allocators exist (EVENT 8000 `event.py:27`, CUTSCENE 8100
  `cutscene.py:37`, CHOICE 8200 `choice.py:35`).
- **Gaps:** **The collision bug (§4).** Per-field auto-counters **reset to 0 per build** → field A's first
  chest and field B's first chest both pick bit 8000 (`GLOBAL_RESOURCES.md` §5) — a latent N-field
  save-corrupter even before the campaign band. Campaign default `8300` is unsafe (treasure overlap). No
  per-field `flag_base` kwarg threaded into `build_script`.

### RECREATE — *set a save to a given story point*

- **Today:** **Not implemented.** `[initial_flags]` in `campaign.toml` is a TODO (`campaign.py` ~:197). The
  kit builds `.eb` offline but cannot deserialize/seed a Memoria save. New-Game-into-a-campaign with a full
  party remains unsolved (the 70→100→entry route crashes on field 100; reach chains via F6→Warp).
- **Gaps:** A save-seeding tool — decode `gEventGlobal` from `FF9State.json`, set ScenarioCounter + named
  flags to a target beat, re-encode. The save surface is fully open (Base64 in JSON), so this is buildable.

---

## 4. The safe-band finding

### The collision (verified arithmetic)

Campaign allocation (`campaign.py:182,247,270`; `CAMPAIGN_IMPORT.md:171`):

```
field i's flag block = [flag_base + i*K, flag_base + i*K + K),  flag_base=8300, K=64
```

Member count is unbounded above — `assign_ids` is `id_base + i` over all forkable nodes; `validate_ids`
caps only the field **id** (4000–32767), not the field **count**.

Real FF9 uses a **contiguous** treasure-chest bitfield at **bits 8376–8511** (130 distinct bits, bytes
1047–1063, written by the same 48 chest fields incl. 115/300/2203). These are save-backed GLOB bits —
writing them corrupts chest-opened state. Overlap, computed:

| Campaign field i | Block | Overlap with real 8376–8511 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8300–8363 | **clean** (tops out below 8376) |
| 1 | 8364–8427 | **52 real bits** (8376–8427) |
| 2 | 8428–8491 | **all 64** |
| 3 | 8492–8555 | 20 real bits (8492–8511) |
| ≥4 | ≥8556 | clean |

So the **first aliasing field index is exactly i≥1**. The kit's *other* bands cannot reach 8376: the census
shows **zero real-used bits in [8000, 8375]**, and the per-field once-counters reset per build, so reaching
8376 would need 376 once-flags in one field — not realistic.

**Status (verdict correction):** the collision is **latent, not active.** `flag_base`/`flags_per_field` are
reserved in `campaign.toml` but **not yet consumed** by the allocators (deferred follow-up,
`GLOBAL_RESOURCES.md:92-94`, `CAMPAIGN_IMPORT.md:71`). No shipped build aliases yet — but the arithmetic
guarantees it once the per-member allocator is wired.

### Recommended bands (provably clear)

The maximum real-used bit in the entire 676-field census is **8511**. The first byte fully clear of all real
usage is **byte 1064 → bit 8512**.

```python
# campaign.py — set BEFORE wiring the per-field allocator
flag_base       = 8512     # first bit clear of ALL real FF9 usage (round: 8520 / 8600)
flags_per_field = 64       # unchanged
CHOICE_SCRATCH  = 16320    # bits @ byte 2040 — reserve at/above this (engine-owned)
# safe field cap: (16320 - 8512) // 64 = 122 fields
```

- Field 0 → 8512–8575 (clear) … Field 121 → 16256–16319 (clear, just below scratch). Field 122 → 16320+
  **collides with the choice scratch** — that is the hard ceiling.
- For breathing room, `flag_base=8600` keeps ~120 fields safely below 16320.

**Also fix the single-field once-counters** (independent of the campaign band): they alias *across fields*
because they reset per build. Either thread a per-field `flag_base` (e.g. `8512 + field_index*K`) or make the
counters globally monotonic within a build. This bug bites single-field imports too once a player saves in a
real field and returns.

---

## 5. Recommended toolkit work (prioritized)

**(1) — Safe-band fix + cross-field lint. ✅ LANDED 2026-06-10 (this branch).**
*Done:* `campaign.py` `flag_base` default 8300 → **8512** (`FIRST_SAFE_FLAG`); added a `flag_base` field to
`FieldProject` threaded through `build_script`/`lint_logic` via the new `build._FlagAlloc` (default `None`
reproduces the historical 8000/8100/8200 bands, so **single-field builds are byte-identical** — golden
preserved); `campaign.build_campaign` assigns each member `flag_base + i*K`, packed cutscene `+0` / events
`+1..+31` / choices `+32..+63`; `lint_campaign` now errors on any member block **or** explicit flag inside
the chest band 8376–8511 or at/above the choice scratch (bit 16320). Tests: `test_build.py`
(`_FlagAlloc` invariants), `test_campaign.py` (collision + safe-band lint). **547 tests pass.**

**(2) — A NAMED flag registry. ✅ LANDED 2026-06-10 (this branch).**
*Done:* `ff9mapkit/ff9mapkit/flags.py` is the canonical `index ↔ name ↔ meaning` registry — engine-grounded
named vars (ScenarioCounter@0, FieldEntrance@2, TranceGauge, ChocoDigLevel), reserved bit regions
(chest 8376–8511, worldmap unlocks, byte-23 handshake, choice scratch), scenario milestones, and the
safe-band constants (now the **single source of truth** — `campaign.py` imports them). Authoring: a
`[[flag]]` table (`name` + `index`, validated into [8512, 16320)) plus a load-time resolver
(`resolve_project_flags`) so `requires_flag = "ice_path_unlocked"` resolves to the index — **byte-identical**
to the numeric form (test-proven). Campaigns share cross-field names via a `campaign.toml` `[[flag]]` table
(`lint_campaign` checks they sit clear of the per-member auto blocks). CLI: `ff9mapkit flags` browses it.
*Guard kept:* the persistent space is never labelled "Glob" (that's HW's transient Map). *(The empirical
seed `research/flag_catalog.toml` fed this; `flags.py` is now canonical.)*

**(3) — A flag inspector/viewer. ✅ FULLY LANDED 2026-06-10 (offline + in-game).**
*Offline:* `flags.decode_gEventGlobal(blob)` + `gEventGlobal_from_save(json|base64|path)` + `render_report`
decode a save's `gEventGlobal` (Base64 from `FF9State.json`, `JsonParser.cs:522`) into a human report —
ScenarioCounter + nearest story beat, IsEikoAbducted, FieldEntrance, treasure-hunter points (engine ranges),
opened-chest count, set story bits grouped by region. CLI: `ff9mapkit flags-inspect <save>`. *In-game
(proven 2026-06-10):* the **F6 → Flags tab** gained a live **"Story state"** readout (ScenarioCounter + beat,
FieldEntrance, TreasureHunter pts via the engine's own `GetTreasureHunterPoints()`, chests opened) + a region
label on Get (`Ff9mkDebugMenu.cs`, patch `s22`). Verified in a real save at Alexandria Castle (SC 7200) —
which **corrected the scenario→beat table**: the old ~11-anchor map mislabelled mid-game (7200 read "Madain
Sari"); now a **census-grounded 43-area progression** (`research/gen_scenario_table.py` → `flags.py`
`SCENARIO_MILESTONES`, mirrored to the C# menu) reads 7200 → "Alexandria Castle". *Caveat:* the on-disc
`EncryptedSavedData` must be decrypted to JSON first; the open JSON/Base64 path is what `flags-inspect` reads.

**(4) — A "recreate" / seed mechanism. [Delivers RECREATE.]**
*What:* A tool that writes a target story state into a save: set `gEventGlobal[0..1]` to a chosen
ScenarioCounter milestone and set named flags, then re-Base64/re-encrypt. Pair with `[initial_flags]`
parsing in `campaign.toml` (currently a TODO at `campaign.py` ~:197) so a campaign declares its entry state.
*Why:* "drop the player at story beat X with these flags set" — needed for testing gated content and for
campaign New-Game entry without the field-100 crash route. *Builds on:* the registry (for names→indices), the
open save format, and the existing campaign entry plumbing (`deploy_campaign.py --no-warp` + F6→Warp as the
interim entry path). *Caveat:* encrypted-save round-trip needs the `EncryptedSavedData` codec
(community-known; `ff9SaveLib` is a reference).

### ScenarioCounter milestones (engine-hardcoded special cases)

*Anchor points, not a continuous scale. (a) for each value↔beat pairing; completeness is low — these are the
beats the engine special-cases.*

| Value | Beat | Tier | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1000 | Game start — Prima Vista / Cargo Room (field 50) | (b) | census + manifest join |
| 1150 | Alexandria / Shop (field 104) | (b) | census |
| 1900 | Burmecia-area gate (field 206 choice) | (a) | `EMinigame.cs:534`, `ETb.cs:424` |
| 4980 | Cleyra Cathedral (field 1109) | (a) | `EMinigame.cs:246` |

## 7. Open questions / further research

1. **ATE / Mognet flag indices.** Mechanism known (gated by `gEventGlobal` bits + ScenarioCounter), but **no
   public index dictionary** exists. Must be reverse-mapped from `.eb` scripts — the census's
   producer/consumer scan is the right tool; cross-reference with in-game ATE availability to label them.
2. ~~**Census write under-count (counters).**~~ **RESOLVED in this branch.** `flag_census.py`'s `ASSIGN_OPS`
   now covers the full `op_binary` assignment family (`0x2C–0x45` = `B_LET … B_OR_LET_E`, the plain-`=` `_A`/
   `_E` variants + every compound-assign) plus in/decrements (`0x04–0x0B`), grounded in `EBin.cs:2423-2485`.
   Re-run confirms **bit-flag findings unchanged (1051 flags)**; absolute scenario values refined 322→**321**
   (one was a compound-assign, not an absolute set); relative scenario ops are now bucketed in
   `scenario_counter_increments` (`++`/`--` ×7 fields each + a few `+=`/`*=`/`/=`/`&=`/`|=`). The `0x20`
   B_EQ-compare that made bit-184 read+write was always correctly *not* an assign — bit 184 genuinely is both
   read (`== 1` guard) and written (`= 0` clear) by ~every field; that is the handshake, not a decode error.
3. **Per-chest bit identity.** The 8376–8511 block is the *scored* treasure region (48 fields, ~130 bits),
   but no public source maps each bit to a specific chest. Enumerating it (chest field × bit) would let a
   campaign safely *reuse* real chests if ever desired.
4. **Complete ordered scenario table.** Only ~15 anchors are named; the full value→beat progression is
   empirically derivable from the census (321 values, single-writer-field for most) joined to the area
   manifest — a worthwhile registry-seeding pass.
5. **Encrypted-save round-trip.** The `RECREATE` tool needs the `EncryptedSavedData\SavedData_ww.dat` codec
   for a real save (the in-memory JSON Base64 path is open). `ff9SaveLib` is a reference; verify it
   round-trips current Memoria saves.
6. **Worldmap-unlock readers.** The 276 "write-only" bits (mostly bytes 92–102) are consumed by engine C#,
   not field scripts — confirming each bit's exact menu/worldmap consumer would let the kit author location
   unlocks confidently rather than by copy.
