"""A protocol stand-in for the in-game agent, so the driver can be tested with no game running.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It implements the s83 wire protocol -- sequence handling,
the arm transition, frame-stepped queue draining, state publication, screenshots -- plus just enough
of a world (a rectangular walkmesh, a run/walk speed, a gateway, a dialogue box, a menu cursor) for
the driver's closed-loop verbs to actually close their loops. A green run against it says the DRIVER
is correct: seq numbers advance, acks belong to the request that earned them, torn reads are
survived, timeouts fire, bad bases are rejected, artifacts land.

⚠ IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE ENGINE. It models the agent as SPECIFIED, not the DLL as deployed -- so
a green suite means the driver still handles what it was taught, and nothing about whether a warp
lands, a button moves a character, or the bytes on disk behave. Those are only ever answered by a
real game, and this project has learned repeatedly that a passing offline gate is a regression
harness, not an oracle.

It exists because the alternative is worse: debugging the driver and the engine at the same time,
through a 40-second game launch, with no way to tell which half is lying.

THE FAULT MODES ARE THE POINT. ``FakeGame(mode=...)`` can be a game that freezes its frame counter,
one that slides the character along a wall instead of walking, one that hands over control before it
has a position, one whose agent kept a stale sequence number, and one that never resets on re-arm.
Each of those is a real failure this harness has produced or nearly produced, and each has a driver
behaviour that must be asserted rather than assumed.
