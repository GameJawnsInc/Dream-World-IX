"""The harness driver: own an FF9 process, drive it, assert on what it does.

This is the half that runs outside the game. The half inside is memoria-patch s83
(``Memoria/Harness/HarnessAgent.cs``); the two meet over :mod:`tools.harness.channel`.

The shape of a scenario::

    from harness import Session

    with Session(label="chest") as g:
        g.newgame()
        g.warp(30810)
        g.walk("up", 45)
        g.press("confirm")
        g.expect_text("Potion")
        g.shot("after-chest")

Every wait is bounded and every failure carries the last known state, because the failure mode that
makes an automated harness worse than useless is one that hangs or reports a green run it never
actually observed.

PROCESS SAFETY. One FF9 install is shared by every concurrent worktree on this machine, and it is also
the machine the owner plays on. So the default refuses to start when an FF9 is already running rather
than racing it, and it only ever kills a process this session launched itself.
